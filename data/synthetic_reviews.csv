Great coffee machine Easy to use, not too big, up to temperature quickly and the coffee is great tasting. The white finish fits into our kitchen well. The only slight downside is the pump on this machine is quite loud when in use, louder than the previous Lavazza pod machine we had. I'd still buy another one though and have recommended this model to some friends.	Coffee Quality, User Experience, Design and Materials	Machine Performance

Great value, tasty Italian coffee capsule machine Recommended by Which and thoroughly deserves the award. Terrific tasting Italian espresso coffee. Very small, compact, well made machine, which is very easy to use. No milk frother, which suits me as I prefer black coffee. Just a pity the pods are not yet compostable or recyclable. A little noisy too which means 4 stars.	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience, Price & worth	Environmental Impact, Machine Performance
Received faulty machine, Lavazza not responding I received a faulty machine. After sending detailed email to the seller (with the videos clearly showing that the product does not work) and kindly asking for contact on the seller's Facebook profile, I still have not heard from Lavazza. I do not recommend it at all. I understand that faulty products do happen occasionally. However, complete lack of response from Lavazza shows very little care for the customers.

A simple but noisy machine This is a very simple machine, one button and one draw. It works pretty well, the coffee is just a tiny bit cold but not enough to worry if it is drunk straight away. The cartridges will probably have to come from the Internet. The downside is that the machine is noisy. I've stood mine of a plastic mat that helps a bit but this is not a machine to use at six in the morning when everyone else is asleep.

Quick and easy, great coffee! Great coffee, nice countertop profile. No need for a larger machine, you can do a lungo if you prefer. Great price too!

Great Coffee Machine It is a great coffee machine, I'm not quite sure why all the negative reviews. Especially for the price you pay and when you combine it with the frother, it is the perfect combination. Swapped my DeLonghi for this as it was dripping constantly after making a coffee and could not be happier! I just wish they would be more options in terms of capsules like the Nespresso has.

Tiny coffee machine for my tiny house It was a while I wanted to try a capsule machine and with this I wasn't disappointed. It takes so little space, it's ready in seconds and does a great job.

Great little machine and great selection of coffee blends to choose from I just love my Tiny'. He may be tiny but he sure 'pulls a punch! This machine delivers an excellent cup of coffee every time and very speedily at that. It's easy to operate and keep clean. And thank you very much for the enclosed samples of your coffee pods delivered with the machine (ranging from strong to milder). I hadn't expected that and it gave me the chance to taste and select those I felt would suit me best before going ahead and buying a box full. I am loving your 'Dolce' coffee pods at the moment and have gone through quite a few boxes of them already I must admit! If I hadn't had to self-isolate I would not have bought a coffee machine and discovered just how delicious your coffee was! Thanks very much m.s.

Nice simple machine, no used cartridge container which prevents smelliness Great product, very good value. I like the way it takes only one pod at a time, other machines pop the pod into a storage area underneath which can smell like fart if not constantly washed (and some are difficult to wash properly), this seems more hygienic.

Noisy espresso machine I have been a Lavazza customer since I moved out for my University degree and I'd say I wouldn't have survived without my espresso. This is the second Lavazza Espresso machine I bought (I had a Lavazza Minú before this) and I always found them very easy to use, cheap and a perfect espresso-maker. This new Lavazza Tiny is a very strong machine (12 bar pressur pump) which will give you a dense, creamy espresso always at the right temperature. For best results, however, I recommend to warm your cup with boiling water. Secondly, it is very small, easy to use (only 1 button to press) and compact coffee machine that you can fit everywhere in your kitchen and it is also a very nice piece of furniture. It will come with a voucher to buy some original Lavazza coffee pods for free, but I recommend to use Borbone Gold for best results (cheaper and tastier than original one). Overall it does the job making small or long coffees but it has two downsides, in my opinion : 1) The water tank is a bit small (0.75L ) and should be refilled constantly 2) The noise!! This is probably the worst aspect of this machine because it is quite noisy and if you are an early-morning person like me it could be a problem.

It's Not White. Bought this to compliment my white kettle and toaster but on unpacking it I found that it was not pure white. I would describe the colour as 'off white' or cream.

Great! But problem with pod tray. I loved this immediately on opening. Used it (very simple) and great coffee, however on second use, the pod tray will not release. Nothing will budge it. I contacted Lavazza for troubleshooting support but was told it had to be returned to seller. Now waiting for a response. I did ask for a replacement but seems it defaults to refund. It’s a shame because it’s a great little machine. I purchased the milk frothing machine to go with it. Great bit of kit. I’m going to miss it until I can replace it.

Best cup of coffee I have six different coffee machines and the last one I purchased was a lavazza An older model and desperately tried to get hold off the water jug at the back of the machine but no one seems To do the spare part as mine had broke transporting it totally my fault. So when I spotted this machine at Amazon on offer I purchased it as I found with the last machine it was definitely the best tasting coffee out of the other five coffee machines I have. And a big plus is now you can buy the compatible pods to fit it Which works out about 10p a cup which is great I would definitely Recommend this machine you can’t go wrong	Coffee Quality, User Experience, Price & worth, Capsules and Compatibility	NONE

Great budget coffee maker I also have a Lavazza Jolie Plus, which is more than double the cost.

Brilliant I was looking at these and Nespresso machines for a long time and the pods and cost. Lavazza was cheaper. I wasn't crazy about the Lavazza filter coffee I'd had in the past, it was fine but nothing special, just good plain coffee. In the end I saw this tiny in white for 35 quid and thought let's try it, Lavazza is quality, and I'd never had pod coffee before. The machine is cute and so small. I have it in my bedroom near desk. Very easy to install and use. People are having problems with the pod tray? No idea what they're talking about. Easy to use. You get a small box with selection of different coffees, tried them, not a bad one but I have my preferences, I bought Pasionale in bulk from amazon at very cheap price. Awesome taste. I won't be going back to filter coffee. I plan at some point to get a Nespresso (in a few months) too so I can have both probably but for now I'm so happy with this, way better than expected, couldn't live without it now. Its so small that it's very portable too. One of the best purchases I've made. Anyone who sees it wants one. Coffee pod reviews, brief: 1. pasionale - chocolatey, strong. bought from amazon 256 pods for 50gbp, great price. 2. qualita rossa - standard coffee taste, strong, good for everyday. 3. tierra bio - light, slight choc, floral, easy to drink. won't buy again: 4. delizioso - mild, not keen on aftertaste. ones i haven't tried yet: 5. decaff - haven't tried. i dont drink decaff. 6. lungo dulce - larger coffee, haven't tried. 7. espresso intenso - havent tried, will try next. the strongest.

Great little machine, but!! Really wanted to like this machine as it appears really well made and compact. Coffee is made quite quickly and all of the range of pops taste nice. The pod how;der has a particularly nice feel to it when replacing pods. If you drink your coffee as espresso in a small espresso cup/glass I'm sure you'll be delighted with this machine. However, if you like a longer coffee in a taller mug as latte or cappucchino then the machine is not ideal as in order to get a mug under the delivery nozzle it is necessary to remove the stand/drip tray before positioning a mug. This is a bit inconvenient, but becomes more of a problem if you do not hand hold the mug in place whilst the machine is brewing as it vibrates to the extent that the mug moves from under the nozzle and your coffee goes over the work surface. I returned our two machines for this reason and bought the Idola model instead which we are very pleased with despite it being 3 times the price.

Waste of money The coffee out of this machine is tasteless plus it was not very hot. The machine is now in the refuse centre as the spent capsule somehow got stuck. I had 2 indifferent cups of coffee; the third capsule refused to come out, it was obviously so embarrassed at its lack of taste it jammed its lid against the draw opening.

Simple to use, small, low profile expresso machine for Lavazza pods. I bought this to replace a Lavazza Fantasia (a much bigger machine which also froths milk) because the heating unit had failed after 3 years of use. As I'm the only person in the home who drinks fresh coffee this much smaller, and cheaper, machine was an ideal replacement. It only makes expresso, but I have a milk jug with a manual frother that I can use if i want to make cappuccino. Expresso is also a good way to go if you are dieting, which I am, as I can then skip the calories in milk. It seems like a good machine so far, which seems to be solidly made.

Quality espresso Superior to my Nespresso! Lavazza coffeepods contain more coffee than Nespresso and an espresso is extracted more slowly. Very tasty. This compact machine does vibrate. My coffee machines sit on a small mat which mitigates this somewhat, once the cup starts to fill it stays in place. I purchased this after reading a Which? review which I don’t regret!

Compact but hold on to your cup! This was too replace my old Modo Mio machine that had given up after several years. I prefer the design of this aesthetically but practically, the cup holder/tray is smooth and too small. I learned this the hard way when my almost full cup of coffee vibrated off and spilt everywhere. I now hold the cup in place as the coffee is made. An annoying ‘niggle’! Otherwise I like the size of the water tank and how easy it is to fill, the small size is perfect and I like the single button to control it.

Qualité de l'extraction A Modo Mio, which I have known for a long time, is for me the capsule system that yields the best result in the cup (slow extraction, coffee quality), with a true crema and not a foam, no matter how fine it may be. This system deserves to be more visible. The machine is very practical: only one button, easy to clean because there is no capsule tray, therefore more hygienic. Short heating time: 25 seconds. It is manual, but that suits me well. It also turns off very quickly if not manually turned off. A blind purchase.	Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	NONE

I bought two bought to replace the broken nespresso, and I find this nice little machine, nice and very easy to use. the coffee goes down slowly compared to the nespresso, obtaining a full-bodied coffee with an excellent taste, superior to that of the nespresso which is more watery. convenient is the pod holder without container, I thought that emptying it every time was boring but no, much more comfortable you don't have to remember to empty the container of used pods that blocks the machine avoiding blockages and sprays nor waste of the damaged pod. an advice don't buy the waffles on amazon because they are old the taste of the coffee knows of old even if they are original pods Lavazza the supermarket near home to better quality at the same price. sorry amazon but it is so.

It can be used both with cups, keeping the cup support container, and with higher cups or glass by removing the support container. Yes, it is not very silent and vibrates, but those who talk about cups that fall if not kept go too far, only if the water level is below the minimum level. For the noise when warming up before the coffee comes out it is a bit noisy. To remedy the lack of the capsule emptying container, I bought a jar to keep close to the machine and the problem is solved. Now I will look for an anti-vibration mat and everything will be ok.

We can no longer do without it. Excellent product, given for the birthday of my boyfriend, who arrived on time, with the first mode in two days. Makes a fairytale coffee, creamy and intense.

Easy to use, practical and simple to clean, quiet, modern design with small size. A machine with a compact and modern design. The orange color is very beautiful because it is shiny and easy to clean. The machine is fairly quiet, simple to use, it has a single button to turn the machine on and off as well as to dispense and stop coffee dispensing. The machine does not have an internal capsule collection container but this may seem like a disadvantage on the one hand, but on the other it is not because since the capsule must be thrown away immediately after the coffee has been dispensed, this allows you to always keep the machine clean. without leaving bad smells. The transparent tank allows you to keep the water level under control. The Lavazza warranty service is also excellent, with the free replacement of the machine with a new one during the two-year warranty. The courier comes directly to the house to collect the faulty machine and at the same time brings the new one. I am really happy with the purchase.

EXCELLENT EVEN FOR THE It is not the first Lavazza capsule machine in my way that I buy ... I needed a new one for the office and I wanted to spend as little as possible ... This cost € 49 and the reviews were positive so I decided to buy it ... The machine is really a wonderful ... It remains in stand-by so it doesn't consume anything then since you click The only button on the machine body within 20 seconds is ready for the coffee that surprisingly comes out really hot ... and even using second choice capsules I drink a coffee of excellent quality ... The trick is in the temperature of the water that really comes out at a high temperature and ideal for making excellent coffee ... Not only that ... Using a common capsule from the cheap tea bought in the supermarket this small machine manages to fill a glass of plastic without losing the temperature by offering you a burn tea ... In this version you have to unload the capsule by hand by unhooking the drawer ... I find it a very practical solution so that the pods do not remain glued and do not end up clogging the drawer and causing blockages ... This also allows you to have a very very compact machine ... Truly an excellent product ...	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, User Experience, Design and Materials, Price & worth, Capsules and Compatibility	NONE

We are not quite there The coffee after all in taste is not bad, but we are not there precisely because, you have to press to stop the coffee dispensing, otherwise it goes on indefinitely, then you must also hold the cup with your hand or with the vibrations it comes out of the plate to then to tip over, and attention is not a defect of some machines but a characteristic of all.

Strongly discouraged I do not recommend this product because at the same price there are models of other brands that are much better and this is all made of plastic, makes a lot of noise and has a really small tank: you will have to fill it continuously. The car is only beautiful aesthetically but otherwise it's not really worth it. Furthermore you can make only coffee and not other beverages as with Dolce Gusto. I made the return and took at the same price a model that makes many drinks that was free with 64 capsules included in the box, this one has only 9.

Two notes on the machine: the quantity of coffee must be manually adjusted by pressing the dispensing button when the desired one has been reached.

Simple and no frills I've been buying Lavazza pod machines for years in my own way and I've always had a great time. I bought this for my parents who, not being a first-hairer, were not comfortable with my car because it was too complicated to use. This one, on the other hand, is very simple, you put one pod at a time and as soon as it is done you throw it away, not having a used pod collection tank. It has a single button with which it turns on / off and makes coffee brew. Very simple to use and above all economical. The only negative things I found are that it is barely noisier than other higher but more expensive models and that you have to remove the cup from under the dispenser immediately as soon as you press the switch to stop the coffee dispensing, because otherwise you will end up with the cup. full of water. Not having the tank to collect the used capsules and the post dispensing purge water, this obviously is purged outside from where the coffee also comes out. Nothing serious, just remove the cup immediately from under the dispenser. For the 40 € I paid for it, that's just fine. Recommended for those looking for a minimal and simple to use pod machine.

SUPERprime Amazon shipping from SUPER Prime machine ordered at 11.00 pm arrived home the following morning at 09.35 MADE OUT !!! The machine works well is not bulky and makes a good coffee, and a good cream of those that slow down the descent of sugar, especially if you use compatible capsules, maybe it will be only a personal matter but the coffee coming out of the original Lavazza capsules at I don't like it very much. It is slightly noisy but nothing exaggerated ... it does not have a used capsule drawer, but you can still live without it. The machine operates at 15 bar of pressure. For years I have used a modified mokona at 20 bar with espresso point capsules and the taste of coffee is the same but this machine costs half. I would say then that quality / price ratio is 10 and praise !! VERY TOP !!	Services and Logistics, Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Capsules and Compatibility, Price & worth	Machine Performance

In my opinion the best capsule system I have had this car for a few months, not taken here on Amazon, and we are very satisfied with the family. I come from a nespresso and I also had a sweet taste, but this is my favorite. For example, the inissia after each coffee continued to drip copiously, while with the tiny stopping the delivery makes two or three drops and stops. It does not have the capsule holder, which could be a defect for some, but in the end it proves an advantage, as there is never anything to empty. It's a bit noisy, that's true, but nothing unbearable. If this should be a problem, I read that the jolie is quieter, plus it has a capsule holder and the cost is almost the same if you take advantage of the offers. As for coffee, compared to nespresso, the original Lavazza capsules in my own way cost less and are easily found online at the same price as the compatible ones, taking advantage of the offers on quantities. There are many varieties of coffee, therefore for all needs. Among those that I have tried my favorites are passionate and cream and taste, but also with compatibles there are great satisfactions. I tried the Bourbons and a very good coffee comes, ditto with the Izzo. Now I am using the insomnia leopard and they surprised me, an intense and creamy coffee with a rich taste comes out! My advice, if you are undecided between the various systems, is to buy this machine (or in general Lavazza machines in my own way), you will not regret it.

Excellent coffee machine, but I recommend ..... Excellent coffee machine, simple to use, quick to clean and requires no special maintenance. I recommend using low-limestone bottled water, better NOT to use the so-called mayor (tap) water as it usually contains a LARGER CALCAREOUS CONTENT. For the rest it does its duty, however it depends a lot on the coffee you use, if of better quality, I recommend not to use capsules purchased in discount stores even if compatible.

Very noisy and too much vibration I replaced my Saeco Piccina model of Lavazza in my own way, buying this slimmer and more attractive design machine. However, as soon as I installed it, I was forced to call Lavazza's customer service, because the machine was very noisy and above all it was vibrating too much. So much so that the kitchen cabinet on which it rested vibrates. At the call center they responded punctually and precisely, making a live video of the operations that gradually showed me to do. All in all it seemed better than at the beginning. But this morning I can tell you that the pans contained in the kitchen cabinet also vibrated. A nightmare!!!!

Lavazza this time you messed up ... zero stars! I purchased the Lavazza Tiny model to replace the previous Jolie model, a huge disappointment!

good car, great coffee I bought this machine to replace a nespresso that was turned off after a year and a half, I already have a minu and to have the same type of capsules I took this for the price lower than the minù although aware of the vibrations as stated by other customers, actually they are right but they are minimal and not always vibrating, for safety I applied some rubber pads that are used for the furniture doors so that the cup does not slip, compared to the minù it is less noisy and the tank is bigger (but I prefer the minù ), I chose this type of machine because it does not have the used capsule drawer and the quantity of coffee is manually adjustable and then the capsules in my own way have 7g of coffee (I use the borbone capsules), the coffee is excellent like the minù .
