Nice I bought the previous model and in this one the water tank is very small as is the container under the glass, I bought it in pink but in fact it is not like in the photo, it is a dull grey pink.	mediaworld.it	4.0	2023-02-27	tinyeco	NONE	Design and Materials, Maintenance and Durability	NONE	NONE

Nice design, great coffee I already had a lavazza tiny machine that left me after about three years, since it made great coffee I decided to buy another one with the new design. The only flaw in my opinion is the water collection container that is too small.	mediaworld.it	4.0	2023-03-04	tinyeco	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality	Maintenance and Durability	Great coffee	NONE

"Not perfect but good. ^_^ I knew this machine because years ago I was given a very similar model. This version seems to have solved some defects found in the old model (eg: Less vibration and noise) and I can consider myself satisfied with the purchase. The only ""negative note"" (if I may say so) could be the cost that when it is not on sale is really out of what for me is considered a normal ""Quality/Price"" ratio which in this case is strongly unbalanced towards the top. Luckily in this shop I found an excellent offer and the shipping/delivery service was equally good."	mediaworld.it	4.0	2023-06-25	tinyeco	Machine Performance, Services and Logistics	Price & worth	Less vibration and noise	NONE

product complaint the machine leaks water at the base. under the warranty I took it to mediaword for repair, but time passes and I find myself without a machine. for this reason I bought another one with the hope that it does not have the defect found in the first one.

I strongly advise against it.

Excellent coffee, small tank, excessively small tray I have the previous model that I use in another house and, since the old tiny one is no longer in production, I decided to buy this one. The positive side is that it makes excellent coffee and takes very little time to heat up. Noisier than the previous one, it also has a couple of other slightly unpleasant defects: the water tank is very small and must be filled continuously and the water collection tray is really tiny and, even if emptied every 3 or 4 dispensings, it fills up and lets the water overflow onto the shelf on which the machine is placed. All in all I would buy it again but it was a step backwards compared to the previous model.	amazon.it	3.0	2024-08-20	tinyeco	Coffee Quality, Machine Performance	Machine Performance, Maintenance and Durability	Excellent coffee	NONE
