Great coffee machine Easy to use, not too big, up to temperature quickly and the coffee is great tasting. The white finish fits into our kitchen well. The only slight downside is the pump on this machine is quite loud when in use, louder than the previous Lavazza pod machine we had.

Great value, tasty Italian coffee capsule machine Recommended by Which and thoroughly deserves the award. Terrific tasting Italian espresso coffee. Very small, compact, well made machine, which is very easy to use. No milk frother, which suits me as I prefer black coffee. Just a pity the pods are not yet compostable or recyclable.

Received faulty machine, Lavazza not responding I received a faulty machine. After sending detailed email to the seller (with the videos clearly showing that the product does not work) and kindly asking for contact on the seller's Facebook profile, I still have not heard from Lavazza. I do not recommend it at all. I understand that faulty products do happen occasionally. However, complete lack of response from Lavazza shows very little care for the customers.	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2019-04-14		Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics, User Experience	tiny
A simple but noisy machine This is a very simple machine, one button and one draw. It works pretty well, the coffee is just a tiny bit cold but not enough to worry if it is drunk straight away. The cartridges will probably have to come from the Internet. The downside is that the machine is noisy. I've stood mine of a plastic mat that helps a bit but this is not a machine to use at six in the morning when everyone else is asleep.	amazon.co.uk	3.0	2020-06-24	User Experience	Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny
Quick and easy, great coffee! Great coffee, nice countertop profile. No need for a larger machine, you can do a lungo if you prefer. Great price too!

Great Coffee Machine It is a great coffee machine, I'm not quite sure why all the negative reviews. Especially for the price you pay and when you combine it with the frother, it is the perfect combination. Swapped my DeLonghi for this as it was dripping constantly after making a coffee and could not be happier!

LOVE IT Small, clean, huge taste, looks like a toy. I had a Dolce Gusto before but the taste of the coffee was not strong at all so I decided to change to Lavazza. I made the best decision !!!

Great little machine and great selection of coffee blends to choose from I just love my Tiny'. He may be tiny but he sure 'pulls a punch! This machine delivers an excellent cup of coffee every time and very speedily at that. It's easy to operate and keep clean. And thank you very much for the enclosed samples of your coffee pods delivered with the machine (ranging from strong to milder). I hadn't expected that and it gave me the chance to taste and select those I felt would suit me best before going ahead and buying a box full. I am loving your 'Dolce' coffee pods at the moment and have gone through quite a few boxes of them already I must admit! If I hadn't had to self-isolate I would not have bought a coffee machine and discovered just how delicious your coffee was!

Nice simple machine, no used cartridge container which prevents smelliness Great product, very good value. I like the way it takes only one pod at a time, other machines pop the pod into a storage area underneath which can smell like fart if not constantly washed (and some are difficult to wash properly), this seems more hygienic.

Noisy espresso machine I have been a Lavazza customer since I moved out for my University degree and I'd say I wouldn't have survived without my espresso. This is the second Lavazza Espresso machine I bought (I had a Lavazza Minú before this) and I always found them very easy to use, cheap and a perfect espresso-maker. This new Lavazza Tiny is a very strong machine (12 bar pressur pump) which will give you a dense, creamy espresso always at the right temperature. For best results, however, I recommend to warm your cup with boiling water. Secondly, it is very small, easy to use (only 1 button to press) and compact coffee machine that you can fit everywhere in your kitchen and it is also a very nice piece of furniture. It will come with a voucher to buy some original Lavazza coffee pods for free, but I recommend to use Borbone Gold for best results (cheaper and tastier than original one). Overall it does the job making small or long coffees but it has two downsides, in my opinion : 1) The water tank is a bit small (0.75L ) and should be refilled constantly 2) The noise!! This is probably the worst aspect of this machine because it is quite noisy and if you are an early-morning person like me it could be a problem.	amazon.co.uk	4.0	2020-07-07	Machine Performance, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny
It's Not White. Bought this to compliment my white kettle and toaster but on unpacking it I found that it was not pure white. I would describe the colour as 'off white' or cream.

Great! But problem with pod tray. I loved this immediately on opening. Used it (very simple) and great coffee, however on second use, the pod tray will not release. Nothing will budge it. I contacted Lavazza for troubleshooting support but was told it had to be returned to seller. Now waiting for a response. I did ask for a replacement but seems it defaults to refund. It’s a shame because it’s a great little machine. I purchased the milk frothing machine to go with it. Great bit of kit. I’m going to miss it until I can replace it.

Best cup of coffee I have six different coffee machines and the last one I purchased was a lavazza An older model and desperately tried to get hold off the water jug at the back of the machine but no one seems To do the spare part as mine had broke transporting it totally my fault. So when I spotted this machine at Amazon on offer I purchased it as I found with the last machine it was definitely the best tasting coffee out of the other five coffee machines I have. And a big plus is now you can buy the compatible pods to fit it Which works out about 10p a cup which is great I would definitely Recommend this machine you can’t go wrong	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2020-01-15	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility		tiny

Great budget coffee maker I also have a Lavazza Jolie Plus, which is more than double the cost. This newer model is well thought out, and I would buy this rather than the more expensive models - higher water capacity, easy to use. Doesn't have programmable volume dispensed, but that doesn't work very well on Jolie Plus anyway	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2020-02-21	Maintenance and Durability, User Experience	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny
Brilliant I was looking at these and Nespresso machines for a long time and the pods and cost. Lavazza was cheaper. I wasn't crazy about the Lavazza filter coffee I'd had in the past, it was fine but nothing special, just good plain coffee. In the end I saw this tiny in white for 35 quid and thought let's try it, Lavazza is quality, and I'd never had pod coffee before. The machine is cute and so small. I have it in my bedroom near desk. Very easy to install and use. People are having problems with the pod tray? No idea what they're talking about. Easy to use. You get a small box with selection of different coffees, tried them, not a bad one but I have my preferences, I bought Pasionale in bulk from amazon at very cheap price. Awesome taste. I won't be going back to filter coffee. I plan at some point to get a Nespresso (in a few months) too so I can have both probably but for now I'm so happy with this, way better than expected, couldn't live without it now. Its so small that it's very portable too. One of the best purchases I've made. Anyone who sees it wants one. Coffee pod reviews, brief: 1. pasionale - chocolatey, strong. bought from amazon 256 pods for 50gbp, great price. 2. qualita rossa - standard coffee taste, strong, good for everyday. 3. tierra bio - light, slight choc, floral, easy to drink. won't buy again: 4. delizioso - mild, not keen on aftertaste. ones i haven't tried yet: 5. decaff - haven't tried. i dont drink decaff. 6. lungo dulce - larger coffee, haven't tried. 7. espresso intenso - havent tried, will try next. the strongest.	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2020-06-07	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics, Capsules and Compatibility	Coffee Quality	tiny

Great little machine, but!! Really wanted to like this machine as it appears really well made and compact. Coffee is made quite quickly and all of the range of pops taste nice. The pod how;der has a particularly nice feel to it when replacing pods. If you drink your coffee as espresso in a small espresso cup/glass I'm sure you'll be delighted with this machine. However, if you like a longer coffee in a taller mug as latte or cappucchino then the machine is not ideal as in order to get a mug under the delivery nozzle it is necessary to remove the stand/drip tray before positioning a mug. This is a bit inconvenient, but becomes more of a problem if you do not hand hold the mug in place whilst the machine is brewing as it vibrates to the extent that the mug moves from under the nozzle and your coffee goes over the work surface. I returned our two machines for this reason and bought the Idola model instead which we are very pleased with despite it being 3 times the price.	amazon.co.uk	4.0	2019-12-27	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability	tiny
Waste of money The coffee out of this machine is tasteless plus it was not very hot. The machine is now in the refuse centre as the spent capsule somehow got stuck. I had 2 indifferent cups of coffee; the third capsule refused to come out, it was obviously so embarrassed at its lack of taste it jammed its lid against the draw opening. Save your money, look elsewhere.	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2019-05-31		Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance	tiny

I work at two sites.I have a nespresso machine at home and at one of the places where I work. Bought this as a Black Friday deal for my other work place. Yes it's a bit noisy but the lavazza coffee is pods give great coffee. I'm getting hot well balanced coffee with a proper Italian crema and far far better quality than a Costa or Starbucks or in fact Weatherspoons whose Lavazza coffee is not good.

Simple to use, small, low profile expresso machine for Lavazza pods. I bought this to replace a Lavazza Fantasia (a much bigger machine which also froths milk) because the heating unit had failed after 3 years of use. As I'm the only person in the home who drinks fresh coffee this much smaller, and cheaper, machine was an ideal replacement. It only makes expresso, but I have a milk jug with a manual frother that I can use if i want to make cappuccino. Expresso is also a good way to go if you are dieting, which I am, as I can then skip the calories in milk. It seems like a good machine so far, which seems to be solidly made.	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2019-11-03	Price & worth, Design and Materials, Brand Awareness	Coffee Quality	tiny
Quality espresso Superior to my Nespresso! Lavazza coffeepods contain more coffee than Nespresso and an espresso is extracted more slowly. Very tasty. This compact machine does vibrate. My coffee machines sit on a small mat which mitigates this somewhat, once the cup starts to fill it stays in place. I purchased this after reading a Which? review which I don’t regret!	amazon.co.uk	4.0	2019-09-22	Coffee Quality	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny
Compact but hold on to your cup! This was too replace my old Modo Mio machine that had given up after several years. I prefer the design of this aesthetically but practically, the cup holder/tray is smooth and too small. I learned this the hard way when my almost full cup of coffee vibrated off and spilt everywhere. I now hold the cup in place as the coffee is made. An annoying ‘niggle’! Otherwise I like the size of the water tank and how easy it is to fill, the small size is perfect and I like the single button to control it.	amazon.co.uk	4.0	2019-08-31	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Qualité de l'extraction A Modo Mio, which I have known for a long time, is for me the capsule system that yields the best result in the cup (slow extraction, coffee quality), with a true crema and not a foam, no matter how fine it may be. This system deserves to be more visible. The machine is very practical: only one button, easy to clean because there is no capsule tray, therefore more hygienic. Short heating time: 25 seconds. It is manual, but that suits me well. It also turns off very quickly if not manually turned off. A blind purchase.	amazon.fr	5.0	2020-05-08	User Experience	Machine Performance	tiny

I bought two bought to replace the broken nespresso, and I find this nice little machine, nice and very easy to use. the coffee goes down slowly compared to the nespresso, obtaining a full-bodied coffee with an excellent taste, superior to that of the nespresso which is more watery. convenient is the pod holder without container, I thought that emptying it every time was boring but no, much more comfortable you don't have to remember to empty the container of used pods that blocks the machine avoiding blockages and sprays nor waste of the damaged pod. an advice don't buy the waffles on amazon because they are old the taste of the coffee knows of old even if they are original pods Lavazza the supermarket near home to better quality at the same price. sorry amazon but it is so.	amazon.it	5.0	2019-08-08	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility		tiny

Small, compact and creamy coffee like at the bar. Good coffee machine, small and compact. The coffee comes out creamy with both original and compatible capsules, such as Vergano or Borbone. It can be used both with cups, keeping the cup support container, and with higher cups or glass by removing the support container. Yes, it is not very silent and vibrates, but those who talk about cups that fall if not kept go too far, only if the water level is below the minimum level. For the noise when warming up before the coffee comes out it is a bit noisy. To remedy the lack of the capsule emptying container, I bought a jar to keep close to the machine and the problem is solved. Now I will look for an anti-vibration mat and everything will be ok.	amazon.it	4.0	2020-01-05	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

noisy While being compact, easy to use and delivering a coffee with a better flavor to my previous Lavazza in my own way (different model), I do not like the noise during the brewing and the vibrations that caused the capsule drawer underneath to move. In addition, the orange color is bright and I preferred it more dull as red.	amazon.it	3.0	2020-04-04	Design and Materials, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance	tiny

Easy to use, practical and simple to clean, quiet, modern design with small size. A machine with a compact and modern design. The orange color is very beautiful because it is shiny and easy to clean. The machine is fairly quiet, simple to use, it has a single button to turn the machine on and off as well as to dispense and stop coffee dispensing. The machine does not have an internal capsule collection container but this may seem like a disadvantage on the one hand, but on the other it is not because since the capsule must be thrown away immediately after the coffee has been dispensed, this allows you to always keep the machine clean. without leaving bad smells. The transparent tank allows you to keep the water level under control. The Lavazza warranty service is also excellent, with the free replacement of the machine with a new one during the two-year warranty. The courier comes directly to the house to collect the faulty machine and at the same time brings the new one. I am really happy with the purchase. The package arrived in excellent condition and faithfully respected delivery times.	amazon.it	4.0	2020-07-15	Machine Performance, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics, Maintenance and Durability	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

EXCELLENT EVEN FOR THE It is not the first Lavazza capsule machine in my way that I buy ... I needed a new one for the office and I wanted to spend as little as possible ... This cost € 49 and the reviews were positive so I decided to buy it ... The machine is really a wonderful ... It remains in stand-by so it doesn't consume anything then since you click The only button on the machine body within 20 seconds is ready for the coffee that surprisingly comes out really hot ... and even using second choice capsules I drink a coffee of excellent quality ... The trick is in the temperature of the water that really comes out at a high temperature and ideal for making excellent coffee ... Not only that ... Using a common capsule from the cheap tea bought in the supermarket this small machine manages to fill a glass of plastic without losing the temperature by offering you a burn tea ... In this version you have to unload the capsule by hand by unhooking the drawer ... I find it a very practical solution so that the pods do not remain glued and do not end up clogging the drawer and causing blockages ... This also allows you to have a very very compact machine ... Truly an excellent product ...	amazon.it	5.0	2020-02-10	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials		tiny

We are not quite there The coffee after all in taste is not bad, but we are not there precisely because, you have to press to stop the coffee dispensing, otherwise it goes on indefinitely, then you must also hold the cup with your hand or with the vibrations it comes out of the plate to then to tip over, and attention is not a defect of some machines but a characteristic of all.

Strongly discouraged I do not recommend this product because at the same price there are models of other brands that are much better and this is all made of plastic, makes a lot of noise and has a really small tank: you will have to fill it continuously. The car is only beautiful aesthetically but otherwise it's not really worth it. Furthermore you can make only coffee and not other beverages as with Dolce Gusto. I made the return and took at the same price a model that makes many drinks that was free with 64 capsules included in the box, this one has only 9.	amazon.it	1.0	2018-05-04	Price & worth, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility	Design and Materials, Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

Compact and pretty car. I purchased compatible Bourbon capsules in a trial kit, the coffee comes out with a nice bar cream, whatever I wanted. Two notes on the machine: the quantity of coffee must be manually adjusted by pressing the dispensing button when the desired one has been reached. At the end of the brewing, I recommend removing the cup immediately because the machine ends with a little ""white"" water which could alter the body of the coffee.

Simple and no frills I've been buying Lavazza pod machines for years in my own way and I've always had a great time. I bought this for my parents who, not being a first-hairer, were not comfortable with my car because it was too complicated to use. This one, on the other hand, is very simple, you put one pod at a time and as soon as it is done you throw it away, not having a used pod collection tank. It has a single button with which it turns on / off and makes coffee brew. Very simple to use and above all economical. The only negative things I found are that it is barely noisier than other higher but more expensive models and that you have to remove the cup from under the dispenser immediately as soon as you press the switch to stop the coffee dispensing, because otherwise you will end up with the cup. full of water. Not having the tank to collect the used capsules and the post dispensing purge water, this obviously is purged outside from where the coffee also comes out. Nothing serious, just remove the cup immediately from under the dispenser. For the 40 € I paid for it, that's just fine. Recommended for those looking for a minimal and simple to use pod machine. But if you want an excellent machine, especially very quiet, take the Lavazza a Modo Mio Idola	amazon.it	4.0	2020-07-20	Price & worth, Machine Performance, Design and Materials, Brand Awareness, Capsules and Compatibility	Price & worth, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Great value for money, but ... The machine is easy to use and clean, moreover it is often found on offer to seize the opportunity immediately. The only drawback is the excessive vibration caused by the machine when dispensing coffee, it makes even a ceramic cup tremble. The noise is also quite annoying. For the rest, if you surpass these defects and you like a quality coffee (I use the original pods), it is a must purchase!	amazon.it	4.0	2020-07-08	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

SUPERprime Amazon shipping from SUPER Prime machine ordered at 11.00 pm arrived home the following morning at 09.35 MADE OUT !!! The machine works well is not bulky and makes a good coffee, and a good cream of those that slow down the descent of sugar, especially if you use compatible capsules, maybe it will be only a personal matter but the coffee coming out of the original Lavazza capsules at I don't like it very much. It is slightly noisy but nothing exaggerated ... it does not have a used capsule drawer, but you can still live without it. The machine operates at 15 bar of pressure. For years I have used a modified mokona at 20 bar with espresso point capsules and the taste of coffee is the same but this machine costs half. I would say then that quality / price ratio is 10 and praise !!

In my opinion the best capsule system I have had this car for a few months, not taken here on Amazon, and we are very satisfied with the family. I come from a nespresso and I also had a sweet taste, but this is my favorite. For example, the inissia after each coffee continued to drip copiously, while with the tiny stopping the delivery makes two or three drops and stops. It does not have the capsule holder, which could be a defect for some, but in the end it proves an advantage, as there is never anything to empty. It's a bit noisy, that's true, but nothing unbearable. If this should be a problem, I read that the jolie is quieter, plus it has a capsule holder and the cost is almost the same if you take advantage of the offers. As for coffee, compared to nespresso, the original Lavazza capsules in my own way cost less and are easily found online at the same price as the compatible ones, taking advantage of the offers on quantities. There are many varieties of coffee, therefore for all needs. Among those that I have tried my favorites are passionate and cream and taste, but also with compatibles there are great satisfactions. I tried the Bourbons and a very good coffee comes, ditto with the Izzo. Now I am using the insomnia leopard and they surprised me, an intense and creamy coffee with a rich taste comes out! My advice, if you are undecided between the various systems, is to buy this machine (or in general Lavazza machines in my own way), you will not regret it.	amazon.it	5.0	2020-01-09	Price & worth, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

I recommend using low-limestone bottled water, better NOT to use the so-called mayor (tap) water as it usually contains a LARGER CALCAREOUS CONTENT.

Very noisy and too much vibration I replaced my Saeco Piccina model of Lavazza in my own way, buying this slimmer and more attractive design machine. However, as soon as I installed it, I was forced to call Lavazza's customer service, because the machine was very noisy and above all it was vibrating too much. So much so that the kitchen cabinet on which it rested vibrates. At the call center they responded punctually and precisely, making a live video of the operations that gradually showed me to do. All in all it seemed better than at the beginning. But this morning I can tell you that the pans contained in the kitchen cabinet also vibrated. A nightmare!!!!

Lavazza this time you messed up ... zero stars! I purchased the Lavazza Tiny model to replace the previous Jolie model, a huge disappointment! The machine has multiple faults: excessively noisy with high vibrations (they cannot be justified for a new product), the platform that holds the cup is too small (it ends up falling) and finally it does not have a waffle collector, for each coffee you have to empty and reinsert the new one! Worse than that !.

good car, great coffee I bought this machine to replace a nespresso that was turned off after a year and a half, I already have a minu and to have the same type of capsules I took this for the price lower than the minù although aware of the vibrations as stated by other customers, actually they are right but they are minimal and not always vibrating, for safety I applied some rubber pads that are used for the furniture doors so that the cup does not slip, compared to the minù it is less noisy and the tank is bigger (but I prefer the minù ), I chose this type of machine because it does not have the used capsule drawer and the quantity of coffee is manually adjustable and then the capsules in my own way have 7g of coffee (I use the borbone capsules), the coffee is excellent like the minù .	amazon.it	5.0	2019-05-02	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, Coffee Quality		tiny

The LAVAZZA A Modo Mio line is a guarantee in terms of reliability on coffee machines For years I have been using the Lavazza line in my own way. Before, I had the Minù who has always done her duty very well. When it broke I found the new one called Tiny, even smaller, I always carry it with me even on vacation. In addition, the Tiny has been improved, less water consumption that accumulates in the recovery tank. Maintenance is minimal, just do the descaling treatment at least once every 2 months, it affects the life of the machine.

Espresso at home In the dispute between A Modio Mio and Nespresso I have always been faithful to the first and this machine confirms all the positive feelings of the previous model, broken after years of honorable service. The whole operation is managed with a single button, so the use is very simple; very rapid setting up of the machine and brewing of the coffee, which in less than 30 seconds from being switched on is ready to be enjoyed. Small footprint for excellent results.

A good coffee I purchased this machine as a replacement for the failed joly lavazza. The comparison does not hold. First of all, it is very simple to use and above all to clean compared to the model with the expulsion of the capsules. The coffee comes out creamier and in my opinion warmer.

We are not I expected much better from Lavazza.

Small and effective coffee machine, though ... I immediately say that the problem of vibrations reported by other users is real. The cup literally walks alone, if you don't hold it, to the point of falling down! I solved the problem by inserting the rubbers under and on the side of the recovery tank, but it is inconceivable that a new product of a famous brand has this problem! Having said that nothing to say about the quality of the coffee, it heats up quickly and is good and creamy.	amazon.it	4.0	2018-10-15	Coffee Quality, User Experience		tiny
a whole vibration not very satisfied not with the coffee he makes but with the vibrations he creates the cup must be kept so as not to drop it from the base for vibrations it does not have automatic blocking of coffee dispensing, so you have to be careful to stop it before it all comes out of the cup, when the capsule is changed, mixed coffee water is made everywhere without having the capsule tank incorporated but if you don't care about these problems for 49 € you can turn a blind eye, excellent Lavazza coffee	amazon.it	3.0	2020-02-23	Brand Awareness, Coffee Quality	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality	tiny

In my own way, like at the bar. Arrived earlier than expected, excellent product and coffee lover what about the show !!!

Compact and small, great coffee ... too much vibration Even smaller and more compact than the minù model, it does not disappoint in taste and ease of use.

Tasty coffee and extreme practicality and elegance Purchased to replace the old model, I find it extremely convenient, fast and gives a coffee with a good flavor.

"Small and unstoppable After years of honorable service, my old ""minu"" had some sporadic power-on problems. I immediately hurried to buy a new small Lavazza machine. The machine comes in a box that includes, in addition to the manuals, a set of tasting pods. The glossy black color is very elegant. The coffee is switched on and dispensed with a single button on the top. When switched on, the flashing indicates the heating phase, the steady light indicates that the machine is ready and warm. I chose the Tiny instead of the Jolie because I prefer not to have the waffle drawer worn out. I prefer to have everything in order and clean, in order to avoid that some careless person in the house (including me), puts another capsule in a full drawer and everything jams. Ultimately, I would buy back with my eyes closed because: - is small - delivers hot and creamy coffee (the use of compatible capsules that I prefer is also fine) - easy to clean. The only drawback, negligible: - moves a little during the brewing phase and is also a bit noisy"	amazon.it	5.0	2020-04-03	User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Machine Performance	tiny

Poor and defective machine I bought this plot by listening to my brother's advice. However, the article certainly did not stand out as being of quality and efficiency. He has always made a coffee, barely acceptable (certainly not a delicacy). And now, after only a few months, the amcchina often has to make coffee! there is very little (drops) and smells of burning. It makes sense to count that now it also loses water from below and puddles on the top of the kitchen, that half is enough !!! I strongly advise against purchasing and if you have someone who really dislikes you, this is the perfect pattern to give !!!	amazon.it	1.0	2020-01-14	Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	tiny

I turned around Spectacular coffee machine. After switching on it is ready to make coffee after 7/8 seconds.

"Good coffee at a great price My old woman In my own way, she broke down in full lockdown, a tragedy to give up on coffee too.

returned The machine is nice and small and very easy to use, but we like hot coffee and it comes out just warm.

Excellent experience Machine very simple to use and clean after use, the small size is really a plus, plus inside you will find a package with a selection of Lavazza coffee, the only negative note if you want to find it is the too vibrate of the coffee machine (especially compared to the old Minù) to brew coffee which, if a plastic cup is used, causes it to fall from the base, after removing this creaminess of the coffee, excellent even with compatible pods	amazon.it	5.0	2020-06-27	Design and Materials, User Experience, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

it is quite a toy, however it's a toy of course, I don't know how long it will last, but for that reason I think it's inevitable.

Really TINY It is my first capsule machine (I used a pod machine) and I must say that I have to take back what I have always said and thought, because without any doubt the quality of the coffee is much higher. This machine is tiny (from the photo you can see it next to a cup), compact, quite silent, but above all very easy to use and clean; the capsule is placed in a completely removable horizontal drawer which avoids annoying jamming and facilitates cleaning (friendly witnesses who have one where the apsule are inserted vertically). Behind the cup-holder grill there is a transparent drawer (I think it is the result of an extra space as it is not even indicated in the instruction booklet) inside which I found a few drops of liquid that might be transhipped from the same drip tray. The product includes a pack of 9 Lavazza pods of various flavors; I tried both original and compatible capsules and in all cases the coffee was full-bodied and creamy. exceeded my expectations, highly recommended purchase!	amazon.it	5.0	2020-06-14	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience		tiny

Good enough I bought this machine to replace my old lavazza in my own way minù no longer on the market and honestly I preferred the first one. This is perhaps aesthetically prettier and easier to use but in my opinion it has too small a space to put the cup. The original pods supplied have a bad taste and I much prefer the compatible ones. Overall still acceptable.	amazon.it	3.0	2020-07-15	Design and Materials, User Experience	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Lavazza my way Tiny easy to use Very pretty aesthetically and easy to use. The coffee is aligned to the standards of the category, therefore good but it is not exceptional to my palate even if the blend you choose does so much. The price is very inviting because with this figure € 49 maybe you don't buy anything of similar quality.	amazon.it	5.0	2020-06-26	Price & worth, Design and Materials, User Experience	Coffee Quality	tiny
Compact and easy to clean Given to my father for his birthday. Arrived well packed and quickly. Aesthetically very pretty and simple to use and clean.

He no longer dispenses coffee as before Purchased a few months ago here on Amazon, 100% satisfied until a few weeks ago when coffee stopped dispensing normally. Change several brands of capsules between original and compatible, but no improvement, even after a descaling wash. I'm sorry because it's compact and simple, but right now I'd let it fly out of the window.	amazon.it	3.0	2018-09-12	Design and Materials, User Experience	Services and Logistics	tiny
Hot coffee This is the perfect construction machine! Little clutter and is activated in no time! The price is low because there is no used pod tray, but you have to empty it every time.

"Lavazza .. My daily choice! A year after the ""death"" of my previous Lavazza coffee machine, I decided to buy the new version (true to the brand!). It works very well, quite silent, simple to use and easily removable / washable parts. The only flaw, the vibrations that sometimes move the cup that moves from the coffee jet and makes it fall out (in the container below, not on the support surface). However super satisfied with the purchase."	amazon.it	4.0	2020-03-23	Machine Performance, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability	tiny
THE PREVIOUS MACHINE WAS BETTER PREVIOUSLY I HAD A LAVAZZA MACHINE IN MY MINU WAY, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD, BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED IN WARRANTY, IT DOES NOT WORK MORE. I HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED TO REPLACE IT WITH THIS, WHICH, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO ME LESS THAN AS THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE EXCESSIVE NOISE IN OPERATION, IN ADDITION IT HAS THE POWER CORD AND IS FIXED WHILE THE PRESSOR IS READING DROP COLLECTION DRAWER MOVES TOO EASY.

Effective and economic, for excellent coffees. Since the previous Lavazza MINU, after about three years, failed, considering that I was fully satisfied with it, I decided to buy this TINY model, with similar characteristics, although more powerful and more capacious (750 cc of water instead of 500). This, unlike the previous one, clearly produces creamier coffees and I don't know if this depends on the greater power or something else. Furthermore, this, although noisy, is a little less than the previous one. Considering the price, rather contained, and the validity of the results, I am more than satisfied and, therefore, the advice.	amazon.it	5.0	2019-09-03	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience		tiny
Good coffee machine! Excellent product, cheap, easy to use, intuitive. It also occupies a small space. Hot coffee but like almost all these small non-boiling machines ... those who like it should heat the cup. The quality of the coffee depends on the capsules. I have tried compatible ones but they don't satisfy. I take the lavazza with the 30% discount by subscription.	amazon.it	5.0	2019-05-06	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny
What is left if not a good coffee? Always a coffee lover, since his birth he has been a lover of capsule machines. I have scattered them everywhere, by the sea, in the mountains, of course at home and even in a camper. Always from Lavazza while not using their capsules. For the price it is a valid product, convenient to insert and remove the capsule, the coffee is hot and creamy, very good! Faults: a little bit slow but acceptable, noisy like all except the very expensive models, it vibrates a lot so it is advisable to put it on a nice rubber mat otherwise you will find the cup on the piece of furniture and the coffee in the drip tray. Good quality / price ratio, in the end his job does it and also well.	amazon.it	4.0	2019-05-20	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	Price & worth, Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

always hot coffee I already had an old-fashioned Lavazza A Modo Mio machine that has done its hard work for many years so when it decided to abandon me I bought another of the same brand and I am very satisfied. The machine is very compact, not bulky and the coffee is immediately ready and hot at the right point. Excellent is the fact that the machine turns off by itself if not used! The only drawback, perhaps, is that there is no pod container used, but with these overall dimensions, it could not be done otherwise. Perfect delivery, in the times indicated.	amazon.it	5.0	2020-07-16	Machine Performance, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny
Excellent machine! Praise to AFTER SALE! Only flaw: noisy, very noisy in the first ten seconds of delivery. But otherwise the machine is fantastic: bar coffee, easy to use and wash. Recommended. Finally, a note dedicated to Amazon: if Amaxon sees that you are interested in a product and you put it in the cart but you don't buy it right away, well the price goes up. And it ends up buying it at a higher price than what I saw the first time. After purchasing, the product drops in price. Amazon sly. UPDATE In March 2020 the car crashed. Despite all the attempts to get it going again, there was nothing to do. Well, PLAUSO ALLA LAVAZZA, I called customer service and after describing the defect two days later, the courier arrived with a new machine to replace the defective one.

Nice machine shame about the functionality The coffee produced is of very good quality, I think this also depends a lot on the type of coffee you use. However, I don't judge the quality of the coffee because I don't consider myself an expert. The machine is easy to clean and use, the only flaw is that to make coffee you have to press twice, once to start and another time to finish, unlike many other machines (espresso, de Longhi etc.). ).

Tiny, but only in the name! It's the second one I buy. I gave one to my parents, the other to a family member. In both cases it was highly appreciated. Inside the box you will find a small selection of Lavazza capsules just to guide your future purchase choices. However, it is also perfectly compatible with capsules from other manufacturers. It is very easy to use, just press a button to allow the drink to be dispensed and press again to stop everything. If the button is held down for longer, the machine switches off. At each coffee it is necessary to empty the capsule drawer. It does not require a lot of maintenance, apart from a descaling that I do about every 3 months with special products. The brewed coffee is excellent (but a lot depends on the capsules you decide to buy). Watch out for the price, given that it is often offered at around € 45 (excellent I would say). I recommend it to all those who want to enjoy a bar-style coffee at home without spending a fortune in the car and capsules as well as to all those who do not have time to prepare the classic mocha. PS since I take coffee in capsules I drink only that, and for a Neapolitan like me it is no small thing .....	amazon.it	5.0	2019-07-27	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

It is certain that this product does not commit too financially and the quality of coffee is of good quality.

"Excellent value for money Highly recommended! The quality compared to the really low cost of this coffee machine is incredible. I already had at home a very expensive espresso machine with a coffee grinder but after a few years, despite the continuous and careful cleaning (even with anti-limescale tablets), unfortunately it dispensed a watered-down coffee with a bad taste regardless of the brand of coffee used. Some friends have this Tiny Lavazza machine at home and I have enjoyed excellent coffee from them, so here I am: Amazon has always guaranteed a super-fast shipping and the integrity of the package and this coffee machine has met my expectations. I prefer the Bourbon capsules to the original Lavazza ones, but be careful to buy the Don Carlo ones, the only Borbone capsules compatible with Lavazza ""A modo mio"", otherwise they don't work well!

Very easy to use and clean. Once the button is pressed, it heats the water very quickly. The coffee is creamy and thick. All the operations are carried out with a single button, I hope and hope that it will not be ruined, because in my old minú that button broke. For the moment, after trying a good bit of coffee, everything seems to be going well; the coffee is good, hot at the right point and creamy. It is also good with capsules compatible with ""Lavazza a modo modo"". The machine is nice to look at, compact, takes up little space.

EXCELLENT ITEM - PURCHASED 2 First capsule machine purchased, consequently before proceeding I carried out various researches. Most of them strongly recommend buying a Lavazza machine for aesthetics and quality. Confident of what I read, I proceed with the purchase. Lavazza machine delivered in 2 days and immediately tested. To date I can confirm what has been read around the internet. The machine that has just come out of the bowl has a very minimal aesthetic, with a reduced size and robust to the touch. After carrying out the instructions for the first accession, I immediately try a coffee (thanks to the 9 test capsules supplied). The machine heats up in less than 25 seconds, once the coffee is made you can immediately notice the creaminess of it. Once tasted, what is said is confirmed. Hot, creamy and full-bodied coffee. Identical, and I repeat, identical to that usually taken at the bar. The capsules vary according to the taste of the coffee, the creaminess remains the same. CONCLUSIONS: really satisfied with this purchase. I confirm all the positive reviews read on Amaozn and around the internet. Excellent machine for quality, ecstatic and price. I am waiting to receive another to be placed in another environment.	amazon.it	5.0	2020-04-07	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	tiny

"Small, simple and good! As per the title of the review: Small, simple and good! When I bought it for the same price I could have taken the Jolie model which is one step higher, but the choice fell on this Tiny (or if it had been available on the Minu) due to their simplicity of construction and cleaning. I come from a Nespresso machine and the cause of his retirement was the obstruction (due to limescale and coffee deposits) of the spout. Despite cleaning with descaler or vinegar, the ""cap"" did not go away and made it impossible to dispense a decent coffee. This Tiny instead has a removable and washable capsule holder that is unlikely to cause such problems"	amazon.it	5.0	2018-10-06	Price & worth, Maintenance and Durability, User Experience	Coffee Quality	tiny

happy with the purchase the machine after a couple of weeks of use is practical and easy to use. Aesthetically pretty and compact it makes an excellent coffee, I took it in place of another one with Lavazza pods that I had for years but had started having some problems, for which I already knew the quality of the coffee and the brand, the fact that it does not have the container of used pods like the one I had previously I consider it an advantage as there is no risk of blocking when the collector is full and it also remains easier to to clean having to empty the special drawer at each coffee ... the use is easy and intuitive and both the vibrations and the noise, during use, are neither more nor less than all the other machines that I have had or seen ... satisfied with the purchase price and the first shipment in a widely respected day	amazon.it	5.0	2020-04-23	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience		tiny

very cute design bought for my mom who loves espresso and broke the previous one. the color is very beautiful and it is small, so it also furnishes the kitchen well. very simple to use, just switch it on, insert the capsule and press the button again until the desired quantity. when you want to make another coffee you have to wait a few seconds otherennti the capsule door does not open I think for safety reasons. coffee not original but still very good and creamy. actually it is not silent but still not as noisy as I had read in the reviews. each tot coffee must empty the container where the cup rests.	amazon.it	4.0	2020-06-20	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Design and Materials	tiny

messy the coffee is good, there are no problems to do it, you just have to go and find a mini cup, otherwise you have to stay with the normal cup in your hand and hold it under the spout tilting it, and even if you have the mini cup you have to hold it anyway because the vibrations of the machine make the cup slide towards the edge ...	amazon.it	2.0	2020-08-01	Coffee Quality	Maintenance and Durability	tiny

Small, beautiful and cheap ... and it also makes good coffee! The little Lavazza arrived on time, in an excellent Amazon packaging and in a beautiful Lavazza box, accompanied by a tasting kit with 9 capsules of different flavors. Taken at the (excellent) price of 39.90 euros for the beach house, I was surprised by the quality that I have perceived since I took it out of the box. Good plastics, well assembled and without creaking, beautiful the completely transparent tank, perhaps a little oversized compared to the car (it disturbs the aesthetic harmony), but very functional and easy to clean and top up. The good functionality is the main advantage of this machine: there is only one button to switch on / off, dispense coffee and stop dispensing: all very simple. Furthermore, the slide capsule insertion system is very convenient and hygienic, personally I much prefer it to the used capsule collector: you lose 2 seconds between one coffee and the next, but you don't risk forgetting to empty the machine, with all ancillary problems; then the machine always remains clean, with no capsules stagnating in the deposit. Let's get to the point: how does coffee make? The coffee is good, but not great. It is delivered hot, as it should be, there are no burnt notes and the aromas of the coffee are well perceptible, even the cream has a good consistency (but it depends on the quality of the coffee). All good, but to nitpick the coffee, perhaps thanks to the delivery pressure of 15 bars (other systems reach 19, 20 bars) is a bit watery for my taste. Much also depends on the delivery speed, which is decidedly high: if you are not careful you will immediately end up with a long coffee. For heaven's sake, for 39.90 euros it is probably the best coffee you can get, and probably my being from Naples has accustomed my palate to robust and creamy espresso. However, I repeat that the coffee dispensed is absolutely enjoyable, the machine is beautiful and simple to use and Lavazza offers coffee for all tastes. Even with compatible capsules it has no problem, indeed with the Bourbons I noticed a better consistency (however de gustobus ...) In short, a good car that I can recommend without reservations!	amazon.it	4.0	2020-07-31	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics, Capsules and Compatibility	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics	tiny

Bad girl Okay compact but not so but. The platform holding the cup is too small and unable to accommodate slightly larger cups. The height space between it and the dispenser is also too limited. Noisy, it seems that I turn on the compressor. Sometimes the vibrations produced by the machine are so high as to cause the entire cabinet and the accessories housed to vibrate and also forcing you to hold the cup during dispensing, otherwise it will inevitably fall. Tasting kit of 9 capsules they give you, it is 1 of each type. I feel to say that if you can, spend a little more and you can truly have a larger capacity.	amazon.it	3.0	2020-08-09	Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	tiny

BEAUTIFUL DISCOVERY, I CAN NO LONGER DO WITH IT I finally said goodbye to the mocha. My family loves it. We offer every guest who arrives home a coffee and I am proud to show them my collection of pods that Lavazza offers. You will make many more coffees and enjoy it will be a pleasure, before with the mocha the waiting time was quite a lot and I passed the desire to wait to get a coffee that most of the time came out dirtying the stove. The black color fits perfectly with my modern kitchen and almost looks like a piece of furniture. It cleans well: for the outside I use a generic product for kitchen surfaces, for the inside I use a descaler once every 3/4 months (using bottled water I don't often feel the need) and the other components I wash them by hand with simple running water. I do not recommend putting them in the dishwasher because my mother-in-law has slightly damaged them. Having coffee in the morning is now quick and easy and I no longer have to give it up. Bought on offer at about € 49. Around € 70 and up. I find that aesthetically it is one of the best, it is compact, easy to assemble and transport and for this reason it is also suitable for those who want to use it for work use as in the office, ideal for beauty salons and hairdressers to offer a coffee quickly and also why not it requires a lot of maintenance. It is convenient, practical and easy to use, also because it has a single on / off button that lights up when it is switched on and turns off automatically after a few minutes of inactivity so as not to waste electricity. The removable and washable parts are: the transparent plastic tank with its lid, the drawer where you insert the pod, the grill and its cap, the internal drip tray. You can put it anywhere, because it is light, compact, does not go unnoticed but at the same time discreet because it is not bulky. PROS: the low price, the fact that Lavazza offers a wide variety of pods and a range of fun colors that you can match your environment. I appreciated the welcome tasting that is honored and which contains about a dozen pods where you can familiarize yourself with the flavors offered and the intensity of the coffee you prefer. I really appreciate the fact that the grill is removable to make room for larger cups suitable for the breakfast latte. However, remember to empty the tank if you do not use it for more than 3 days and to replace the water. CONS: maybe the length of the cable is too short for those who want to hide it behind a piece of furniture, even if I don't have this problem and it's perfect for me TIP: you could devise an adjustable system to adapt the length of the cable according to your needs	amazon.it	5.0	2020-09-16	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Brand Awareness, Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, User Experience	tiny

Great little machine (Especially for the price) I just received it and have made a few coffees with the supplied pods - yes, it comes with a range of lavazza coffee pods to sample - and I love it. The flavour is great and the water temp is perfect. Very easy to use and clean etc. I chose this one over the Jolie because it creates 15 bars of pressure as opposed to 9 bars with the Jolie, which relates to a better extraction (theoretically). I also bought the lavazza milk frother and together they make a near cafe quality coffee, not quite as strong in flavour but close enough. For a basic and cost effective home coffee set up and a good price, I would recommend this machine - and the frother.

What's great about coffee, I'm on my second brand new unit; The first would not stop pumping water even when it exhausted the water it continued to pump.

Good coffee machine My Nespresso Krups abandoned me after years and therefore I decided to change and switch to this Lavazza machine. Punctual shipping and package arrived in excellent condition. I've been using it for about a month and I've tried both Lavazza capsules and various types of compatible capsules. As for the coffee, it looks very good, boiling at the right point and creamy, even if I must say that I find that of Nespresso a step forward, both in taste and in density. It is very compact and aesthetically pleasing, has a fairly large water tank and does not have a used capsule system. A negative note is that it makes a lot of noise, when it is in operation the whole kitchen counter vibrates. In general I can be satisfied.	amazon.it	4.0	2020-10-27	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

Too bad for the capacity !!!! But good in substance The machine basically works well, the only problem is that it doesn't have a pod drawer and personally I didn't understand it from the description so every coffee needs to be cleaned. The liquid container is very small. At the same cost, I prefer the other lacavazza model in my own way which can hold up to 5 waffle scraps.

Second machine to blow up This looks like a nice machine and I like the coffee. However, the first one went bang and turned the lights in the kitchen out, and the switch on the replacement (there is only one switch) also went bang after only two cups and could not be turned off other than switching off at the plug. NOT happy about two machines going wrong straight away. Also the replacement arrived without an Amazon box so returning is not easy. I will ask for money back now and buy a different machine.	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2020-10-30	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Services and Logistics	tiny

I never thought it could be this good! Having a passion for coffee I use the DeLonghi Prima Donna bean to cup machine at home. But for the office I needed something simple to use, easy to keep clean, that couldn't be messed about or cause problems. Tiny is perfect. So I bought a capsule machine, or so I thought. But no. This is NOT a capsule machine. This is an Espresso machine. Most capsule machines simply rinse out the pod, washing the water through the coffee and giving a product that could come from a jar or a presse. That wasn't what I wanted. Tiny gives me perfect coffee every time, an espresso that could have come from a Gaggia machine in a bar! Simply heaven on earth.	lavazza.co.uk	5.0	2020-10-01	Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability	tiny
Ottimale! It responds very well to my needs: the dimensions are right for my little space in the kitchen, the color and design I like very much, they make it a beautiful piece that is aesthetically pleasing and appealing, without having spent an exaggerated amount. The coffee is hot (very important point for me) and it was what worried me, given the low cost, instead I feel more than satisfied. Very quick to turn on and warm up, comfortable and functional. The problems I have read on the web regarding vibration and noise seem exaggerated to me, to me the cup absolutely does not escape from the base and the noise honestly seems to me more than acceptable and bearable (very normal for a machine dispensing). The drawer system for the capsule does not bother me, it is emptied immediately, without the need to accumulate the capsules or risk them getting stuck.	lavazza.it	5.0	2020-07-29	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

Lavazza Tiny My old Lavazza A Modo Mio had stopped working and I wanted to replace with another Lavazza Machine. I was originally looking at a more expensive machine that uses the same coffee Pods but having read other reviews I decided to save my money and try the Lavazza Tiny instead. Its smaller that my previous machine and to be honest looks cheaper in my opinion but is easier to clean and takes up less room on the worktop. Its heats up quickly and the cup tray at the bottom is removable so you can use a normal mug underneath. Coffee is exactly the same so have saved my money for something else!	ao.com	4.0	2021-01-20	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, User Experience	Price & worth	tiny

I wouldn&#39;t buy it back It vibrates a lot when you make coffee so much that the cup doesn't stay still and risks falling, plus it dances the whole kitchen surface! moreover it only works with coffee pods, it does not make any other drink (no tea, no chamomile, no chocolate, etc.) I would not buy it again	amazon.it	3.0	2020-12-30		Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny
Low quality Between home and office, in the last 15 years I will have collected a dozen Lavazza coffee machines and I couldn't help but notice that the more time passes, the more the quality of these machines deteriorates: not even 6 months and it is already to be thrown away. I will have to decide to buy a branded appliance, perhaps Italian rather than a further Chinese one, even if it is branded Lavazza.	amazon.it	1.0	2020-12-13		Maintenance and Durability	tiny

"Excellent machine but ... (comparison with the small Crema e Gusto machine) In the past I had the small Crema e Gusto coffee machine that I had to change because it was leaking water from both the tank and the dispensing spout. The Lavazza machine is sturdy, a little deeper than Crema e Gusto and has a very large water tank that does not need to be removed to refill. This is a great advantage as the seal is not stressed and damage is avoided. It is overall bulkier than the small Crema e Gusto. It is very easy to clean and requires no maintenance. With one pod you make only one coffee, while with Crema e Gusto the second coffee, even if not for bars, can always be used. Lavazza pods cost significantly less, so they balance this point. Although I am a big user of Lavazza coffee (Crema e Gusto classico) with the traditional coffee machine, I found the quality of the electric one a bit disappointing. I tried the various essences provided by the machine (intensity 9) but they did not convince me. Now I use Crema e Gusto Classico (intensity 12/13) but I must say that I miss the ""Ardenzia"" pods of the Crema e Gusto machine which were really good. Amazon as always is unsurpassed in service."	amazon.it	5.0	2020-12-16	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability	tiny

Nespresso coffee tastes better I bought this Lavazza AMODOMIO machine by reading the positive reviews, the high pressure of the boiler, and after having tasted the coffee, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Nespresso is better, for example using the same Bourbon coffee capsules, on one and the other, Nespresso is creamier, tastier, there is little to do, I will not buy AMODOMIO machines again.	amazon.it	3.0	2021-01-14	Coffee Quality	Coffee Quality	tiny

Excellent machine for &quot;home&quot; use In spite of its size (it is among the smallest on the market, but I chose it for this very reason) it gets along very well: the coffee it produces is good in both flavor and temperature. Depending on the capsules used, the creaminess is more or less present, but the machine does its job. It does not have a drawer in which to store the used capsules, but honestly I see it more as a value than a defect: once the coffee has been made, the capsule is thrown away and, if needed, the drip tray is emptied: it always does not weigh at all, when it is needed emptying 8-10-12 capsules with their liquid residues becomes a bit annoying, at least for me.	amazon.it	5.0	2021-02-02	Coffee Quality	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Great little good value machine (if on offer) So I am a bit of a coffee lover and already have a couple of Nespresso machines and in the past have used both Dulce Gusto and Tassimo machines. I had heard good things about Lavazza coffee and saw this machine on offer at £39 at John Lewis. I've been using it for a few days now and some initial thoughts :- It's very compact and easy to use. Beware unlike some of the more expensive machines it is a manual button so you can't just press it and leave it. I'd seen some reviews that it make a lot of noise. I haven't found that. It's quieter than my Nespresso machine. The coffee produced is hotter than my Nespresso machine and using the pods is straight forward. It also heats up very quickly and the water container size is generous for something this size. The box came with a selection of 9 coffees (I'd seen some YouTube videos with 12). So on the downsides ... I find that the flow of coffee is very slow - more like a dribble at times and that means it takes a while to actually fill the cup. Indeed one time it auto switched off after the 100 seconds or so as it took so long. Also this will not suit you if you like a big Americano - you can only fit a small sized mug underneath - it really is an espresso or long black type machine. I'm not sure I would pay the full price for it. And although it makes a very nice cup of coffee there is not the choice of blends like there is with a Nespresso machine.	amazon.co.uk	4.0	2021-03-10	Machine Performance, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability	Price & worth, Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny

almost perfect compared to the same previous model, the water tank has been improved, its recirculation at the end of the coffee, and above all the on / off system; however, it is a little noisier and the capsule extraction system is a little uncomfortable, as it drips if you are not more than careful; unbeatable price even compared to direct sales by Lavazza; Amazon early delivery	amazon.it	4.0	2021-03-20	Price & worth, Services and Logistics	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

Ok, after a year everything is ok Review after exactly 1 year of use. Among the machines I have had, even from other brands, it was the one that over time had less problems, it worked regularly and continuously for an average of 10 coffees a day. The system is very quick and intuitive, it has a tray that is not excessively large but this type of machine, which does not even have a basket for used capsules, must be placed near a sink and a bin so I do not recommend buying it if you have to use it in places where you do not have easy access to both the sink (or anything to drain the water) and a bag to throw the capsules. I have one in the garage and I have equipped myself with 2 containers that I empty every 30 coffees. If you can live with these 2 features buy it, otherwise and inevitably you have to go up the price range.	amazon.it	5.0	2020-04-08	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility		tiny

I expected better Before this I had the Jolie model, which due to malfunctions I had to replace, and finding myself comfortable with Lavazza I took this model. At first glance it looked quite similar, indeed it seemed even more compact and resistant, but never judge the book by its cover! As soon as it was turned on, it took a little while to warm up, but as soon as it started it vibrates in an absurd way! I think it has the most powerful pump to create many vibrations, but this disfavors the position of the cup as the coffee moves as it comes out, and also the coffee comes out a little wrong from the spout. Honestly, I don't know whether to think if it's a problem with this coffee maker or if they're all like that. As for the rest it is quite good, the water container is large enough, resistant and does not create steam; the taste of the coffee (even if it varies from the capsules you use) is quite good and does not come out burnt.	amazon.it	3.0	2021-03-22	Maintenance and Durability, Brand Awareness, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability	tiny

Nice design, abundant use of plastic and creamy coffee After years, a Lavazza Minù broke down for the umpteenth time, I got tired of repairing it and so I replaced it with the new model, always with A modo Mio capsules. I must say that in terms of operation it has a superior performance, while as far as aesthetics are concerned, it is very nice and the orange color makes an impression, however there is a large quantity of plastic for aesthetic purposes only and in my opinion also of lower quality than the previous model. I've been using it for a few days and I must say that the coffee is creamy and with an adequate temperature between 80 and 90 degrees with even higher peaks, as should be the rule to have a good coffee worthy of the name. The pods I use are the compatible ones, tested for years now, I honestly don't like the Lavazza originals, I also try the gifts in the package but I threw the rest away ... I find them either strong or watery ... my taste of course! In terms of noise, compared to the old model the sound of the pump is more muffled but produces a decent vibration on the support surface ... let's say that in the early morning it helps to wake up the family :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:, a little less than the sound of the old one. it was like jackhammer! Overall it's a good machine, plasticky but minimalist design and hopefully it will last 7 years like the old Lm 500 (I doubt it). What I did not like is visible in the comparison between the two final cleaning trays, the new one has a narrow and low but deeper tray ... so it will need to be cleaned and emptied frequently (reason of one star less ). It remains a simple product, suitable for people like me who go in a hurry in the morning and don't want to give up a good coffee.	amazon.it	4.0	2021-04-15	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Machine Performance, Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality	tiny
Not good value since low build quality, but it works. How long will it last, though? Bought for my mother, and she likes using it. I don't like using it much since it has low build quality, and poor value therefore, but at least it works. So that's why 3 stars out of 5 for 'ease of use', or overall, since 'flavour' (coffee machines do not have a 'flavour') & 'blending power' (a coffee machine only passes water THROUGH the coffee) are NOT relevant descriptors of a coffee machine, since it is NOT a 'blender' of any description nor is it a thing a person eats.

Article that is the most popular In the specific context this machine is quite well known and appreciated. Of little space, it is used with substantial ease, ordinary maintenance with descaler every two months. The coffee comes out at a fairly high temperature, certainly not hot (at least the first cup). On the market it comes with a wide range of colors, the cheapest are white and black (moreover the white article is, in fact, two-tone since the base is always black). Always short wire so you must opt for a socket as close as possible. Affordable price, delivery quite early compared to the indications.	amazon.it	4.0	2021-04-24	Price & worth, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Machine Performance	tiny

It&#39;s my second Lavazza Tiny because ... I bought this affordable coffee maker. Actually it is the second of the same species. My experience on: PRO - Aesthetically it does not clash; - Very fast in warming up; - easy to use; - With compatible blends and with a taste decided by me better than if; - it is easy to clean; - possibility to buy compatible drinks. VERSUS - the coffee is not always hot; - pay attention to the water used in order not to affect the limestone (easily removable with vinegar or specific product washes); - It is not very quiet (but this is a detail).	amazon.it	5.0	2021-04-16	Price & worth, Machine Performance, User Experience, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Machine Performance	tiny
honesty Simple is simple, it heats up in about 2 minutes, the only drawback is the noise of the pump when you let the coffee go down. This is not particularly pleasing to my cat who runs away every time. Being the third one that I take from Lavazza and the first with the new design (you should know that they are machines that last a couple of years, then they are to be thrown away because it is not economically worthwhile to put them in place), however, I would recommend it. .	amazon.it	4.0	2021-04-07	Brand Awareness, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability	tiny

Recensione Tiny The car looks great to me, just bought it. It seems to me that it solved the problem of a previous model (water leaking into the cup with consequent unpleasant dilution of the coffee). It is not clear on the site the Tiny product page. In the service section, the descaling procedure is clearly described, but since it speaks of points 4 and 5 in point 6, it would be better to number the points of the operations to be carried out.	lavazza.it	1.0	2021-04-28	Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Services and Logistics	tiny

Easy, comfortable and practical. It reaches the temperature in seconds, is easy to use, (it only has one button). In the video it was noisier than it really is, due to the support surface. The only thing that gave me problems was the choice of coffee. Besides the supplied samples, I have tried other original capsules, but the only ones I liked are the deca and ginseng. Then they let me try the compatibles, (compostable), of the Eurospin and I liked them (however this is a subjective consideration).	amazon.it	4.0	2021-05-08	User Experience		tiny

Lavazza for life I have been a loyal Lavazza customer for years, for me coffee is only Lavazza. For this I am biased. I bought the machine a year ago, after trying capsule coffee in a shopping center through a promoter. I must say that the cost of the machine on Amazon was much lower, so I decided to buy it here. To date I have never regretted the purchase. At the moment I use it several times a day to make 6 to 7 coffees for the whole family. It didn't give me any problems. The only downside is the cost of the capsules that I always buy here on Amazon when I find them on offer.	amazon.it	4.0	2021-05-11	Brand Awareness, Maintenance and Durability	Price & worth, Services and Logistics	tiny
Had two faulty machines before getting one that worked The first machine blew all my electrics, the replacement looked as if it had already been returned before (damaged packaging and the free coffee pods were missing) and when I tried to use it the water wouldn’t heat up plus the on/off switch wouldn’t turn off. I was given a refund, no quibble so was relieved and I bought one of these machines from another supplier and it’s absolutely brilliant and use it with the matching lavazza milk frother - very pleased with them both.	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2021-02-08	User Experience	Machine Performance	tiny

Functional and space-saving machine Practical, compact and elegant, excellent machine, once the button is pressed, the light on the button flashes to indicate that it is heating up. As soon as the flashing stops, it is ready. Pay attention to the type of flashing, if it is fast, it indicates that the water tray is not inserted properly. The capsules are inserted very easily (even the compatible ones). The water collection trays are removable and cleaned easily (not necessarily every time, as it has sufficient collection capacity). Negative notes nothing special, perhaps just the vibrations, when it makes coffee, especially with compatible capsules, it tends to be a little noisy, but nothing annoying.

It costs little because it makes espresso, nothing else, but it does it like a god. Simple to use, it has only one button. Very easy to clean, the capsules do not make a mess and you do not have to disassemble anything. I bought one for home and shortly after one for work. My colleagues really appreciate it.

Great buy for singles Pros: - easy to use - no mess - capsules of various brands and flavors are easy to find - the coffee is good (of course it depends on the type of capsule - box of nine capsules included in the package Cons: - For my tastes the coffee could be just a little bit warmer (it is better to wait a few seconds after the light is on, and probably in winter it would be better to heat the cups in the microwave). It is not that it comes out cold or lukewarm, it is absolutely drinkable even like this, but I like it boiling hot...	amazon.it	4.0	2021-06-01	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, User Experience, Capsules and Compatibility	Coffee Quality	tiny

Somewhat disappointed The Lavazza Tiny Pod machine was a bit disappointing simply because the coffee produced was not hot enough and the Lavazza taste was not evident in any of the sample pods or even with the Lavazza Rossa pods. We normally use a stove top percolator with Lavazza Rossa coffee and the results are far superior to the Tiny machine. I admit that the machine is very convenient and easy to use but the output is sub standard with the result that we have reluctantly returned the machine to John Lewis. It is also worth noting that it is substantially cheaper to use the stove top percolator with the ground coffee compared to the expensive pods.	johnlewis.com	2.0	2021-06-14	Price & worth, Design and Materials, User Experience	Machine Performance	tiny

Super little coffee maker Firstly let me say I love coffee. Secondly I have had and still use too many coffee makers, moka pots, nespresso, cafetières, pour over and espresso pump machines. For the money and what it does this little machine wins over them all. So much so I have one in the home office and one in the kitchen. Now I already like lavazza coffee and buy my pods when Waitrose has them on offer. All of the coffee options are good for me but I have tried generic brands from elsewhere which were not bad. The tank can be refilled without being removed which is a plus for me. There is no silly pod catcher that never holds enough so you still end up washing more parts and making more mess. One pod one coffee and pod goes in the bin simple. I don't find it any noisier than a boiling kettle so my wife not bothered by my early morning espresso or my late night coffee in the office. It has auto off if you forget to press the single button on the top for 6 seconds to turn it off. I haven't told my wife how much money I could have saved if I had bought this earlier.	johnlewis.com	5.0	2021-05-27	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Brand Awareness	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Coffee machine my way It works great, never a problem. It has a really powerful compressor. All the capsules fit in it... that's why I bought it. You press the button and it starts flashing, then it becomes fixed, it means it's at the right temperature. Then you press it again and the coffee made well comes out, then you press it again when you want it to stop. If you get distracted it fills the cup and continues... but that's fine. You dose as long as you want. I recommend using the water purification bag right away (which is easy to refill). It keeps the system efficient. Limescale does not form which would otherwise block the small pipes. I recommend.

Love this but.... It's a great little machine, I especially love the front loading which means it can be sited in more places. BUT.... the dosage is too long and not changeable, the majority of your pods are espresso, so why isn't that your default timing? Also, crema is disappointing, just doesn't seem to be powerful enough to create anything substantial. Overall: almost perfect for the 1-3 cup a day house.	lavazza.co.uk	4.0	2021-08-12	User Experience	Coffee Quality	tiny

Perfect!! As a user of Nespresso products I have to say I made an excellent choice. Compact machine, easy to use and clean, thanks to the use of only one capsule at a time. Furthermore, thanks to its versatility I can drink Borbone coffee which in terms of quality/price ratio I think is unbeatable. As for the noise, I do not feel it is different from many other machines I have tried; in fact, it seems even less noisy than my last Nespresso.

Great Lavazza replacement Bought this to replace older version we’ve used for over 4 years making thousands of delicious cups of coffee until it started leaking and pod drawer kept jamming. Pleased with this replacement. Unlike some reviews I’ve read it is not overly noisy. In fact slightly quieter than the old one. Not sure it will be as robust as the previous machine. It’s a lovely size for our small kitchen but my husband can’t get his big mug under without having it at a slight angle. My more normal size mugs fit fine with the drip tray removed. Simple on off button. Parts are easier to clean too. Overall very pleased and glad we’re still getting our delicious Lavazza coffee.	ao.com	4.0	2021-09-09	Machine Performance, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Brand Awareness	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	tiny

perfect in every way... too bad they don't last long Excellent, I switched from the previous version (it broke after a few months of life) to this model, and thank goodness I didn't let myself be convinced by the reviews (perhaps by those who have other even quieter models!). I was about to give up, everyone complains about noise and strong vibration. Well, the noise is much less than the previous one; the vibrations are almost the same (depends on what surface it rests on), however not enough to give up on the machine in question. I am fully satisfied.

The perfection and attention to detail of Italian coffee Lavazza had conquered me in Italy when I tried the machine during a recent trip. The magnetic capsule tray is completely innovative, very satisfying, and very quiet. The machine arrived perfectly packaged in the Amazon packaging and double packaging in the Lavazza box itself. Perfection. The machine is beautiful, stylish, and very easy to set up (there are precise instructions) and then operate. There is even a safety feature in case the machine is triggered and you try to remove the tray while the coffee (or emptying) is being done. This last one is magnetized and prevents it from being removed by mistake and scalding yourself in this case. There is even a box of Passionale capsules that are delicious (the same ones I ordered elsewhere). You simply need to monitor the flow to stop it when you are satisfied (extra short, short, long, etc.). One button and it's done (and the machine turns off by itself after a few minutes). The machine is also very quiet and the heating time is faster than Nespresso machines.	amazon.fr	5.0	2021-09-02	Machine Performance, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics, Capsules and Compatibility	User Experience	tiny

fast delivery - machine identical to the one found in the Amazon store, always on-time delivery is now a guarantee. -For the coffee machine, the important thing is to clean it every month with kitchen vinegar, especially for limescale. Fill the water tank halfway with kitchen vinegar and leave for at least a couple of hours, then drain the vinegar by turning it on (making coffees without capsules). After using up the vinegar, repeat the operation with plain water, preferably iron water, until completely clean (the water is clear, limpid) and finally make a couple of coffees and throw them away. The machine will thank you. Cleaned with a natural product, it will last a lifetime.	amazon.it	5.0	2021-10-09	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics		tiny

Beautiful but .... 4 stars in general, the fifth is missing because it has 2 flaws in my opinion. 1- it is noisy compared to other similar machines; 2- if by chance you use pods with drinks with powdered milk you must never forget to rinse the spout and the collector of excess liquids well. If you forget, in the long run the machine gives off terrible odors and cleaning becomes a nightmare. I had to buy another one for this very reason, and forget about sanitizing products: they do not eliminate the bad smell especially from the valve under the water tank. I bought it again anyway because the coffee is good, especially the original Lavazza capsules or the rare compatible ones. The more you use it, the better the coffee tastes, but never neglect cleaning.	amazon.it	4.0	2021-09-26	Coffee Quality	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny

Excellent coffee The machine works very well and makes excellent coffee (obviously a lot also depends on the quality of the coffee in the capsules). The only drawback is that each capsule, once the coffee is made, remains in the insertion compartment, so it must be removed every single time you make a coffee. It does not have, for example, the tray where the capsules fall after making the coffee. It is not a big problem but for those who make a lot of coffees it could be a nuisance.	amazon.it	4.0	2021-10-24	Coffee Quality		tiny

Small, easy to use and clean. Good coffee After years of Nespresso I wanted to change to the A modo mio system, especially because the capsules contain over 2 grams more coffee and then I wanted to give an Italian company a chance. I therefore chose Tiny for its size and because (some may find it strange) it does not have a drawer for used capsules but only a trolley that can be washed easily. I have always thrown away the used capsule even when I had machines with the drawer. There were higher-end models but I wanted to try in the meantime. The coffee is generally good, with many capsules the extraction is correctly slow (about 20 seconds), unlike Nespresso which fills the cup in 5 seconds. In addition to the originals, there are many compatible ones (I think it is just behind Nespresso for variety). I still find the Lavazza Passionale very good. For the rest, the machine is not exactly silent and you can hear all the pump bars. In my opinion, with a slightly lower pressure the coffee would be even better. As for the temperature, I am used (but this with every machine) to warming the cup and the machine by letting hot water come out empty. Satisfactory results. Overall, promoted! ps: it would be convenient to have the possibility of having the automatic stop of the dispensing but it is a forgivable lack related to the price range	amazon.it	5.0	2021-11-25	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny

Defect The machine itself is easy to use and clean but it has a huge defect... and it doesn't depend on the container.

Very easy to use, easy to clean. First capsule coffee machine I bought. Very easy to use, by pressing the only button on the machine once, it lights up flashing for just a minute, the time it takes to warm up. Once the flashing stops and after inserting the capsule into the compartment, you just need to press the button once to dispense the coffee. After the desired amount of coffee, you press the button again to stop dispensing and after a few minutes of inactivity the machine turns itself off. Very convenient. In addition, the compartment is designed for a single dose, so once you have finished making the coffee, to make another you are forced to remove the capsule. Easy to use, easy to clean, happy with the purchase. After months of intense use, it still works perfectly and dispenses coffee as good as the first day of use. I have not reported anything abnormal, everything as described.	amazon.it	5.0	2021-12-16	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics, User Experience		tiny

Great, if you follow the 'preheating' method Preheat the machine and your cup by following the cleaning routine to fill your cup with hot water. When your cup is hot, pour the water away, insert the coffee capsule and make delicious hot coffee. When mains cold water was used in the cold machine, without this process, the resulting coffee was weak and warm, not flavoursome and hot. Only takes a moment to do.	johnlewis.com	4.0	2022-01-13	Coffee Quality	Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny
brilliant This is the second of the small Lavazza Pod Coffee machine we have bought as it works extremely well with the Lavazza milk frothier.

From Nespresso To Lavazza Bought this as a gift and I'm now a Lavazza enthusiast, having used Nespresso for over 10 years! Will now be purchasing Lavazza myself. Lavazza pods cost less than Nespresso pods and are easier to get hold of. They contain more coffee per pod and are 100% compostable - no hassle of sending the pods off which you have to do should you want Nespresso pods recycled. Superb tasting coffee, eco credentials and excellent value for money!	johnlewis.com	5.0	2022-01-07	Brand Awareness, Coffee Quality, Price & worth, Capsules and Compatibility		tiny
Great Coffee I was so pleased to find a coffee machine that was small enough for my kitchen. It makes a good cup of coffee very quickly. I put a dab of nail polish on the transparent lid of the water tank to remind me to take it off before pouring in the water!

Very good :red_heart: I have been buying this brand for years because I have found it good and the quality/price ratio is excellent. Obviously they are not eternal machines, but the coffee is excellent. The pods are not very cheap but the compatible ones work very well and the coffee is good.

Good things come in small packages This machine is good, not great. It's size is fab but the water container is small and needs frequent filling plus the size means that there isn't enough room for larger mugs when you make a cup of coffee.

fast convenient coffee good to have if you need an espresso quickly I had rated this with 4 stars for a year and this is an update. unfortunately slightly after a year of purchase this machine gave up completely - the insertion of the pods had become totally inconvenient as the bit of plastic that holds them in place had given out but then it just refused to pump water or whatever it does to push the water through the pod altogether. Plus I could only get the pods from sainsburys as the cheap ones from amazon made very plastiky tasting coffee!	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2020-07-25	User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Gift for parents They had been asking me for a coffee machine with pods for a long time. They wanted something practical to quickly offer coffee to guests. This machine does its job.

Yes and No Simple, space-saving. Minimal. I don't like that in 7 years I've bought 4. With the lever and the button. In the end you have to throw them away, after a maximum of 1 and a half/two years because they always have the same defect. They leak water. Lavazza either makes this model or increases the price exorbitantly. And I don't like that depending on the color the price changes a lot. I think it's a joke. The last one I bought (I usually bought them at the store). Ps after a while it also becomes particularly noisy.

Broke after not even 2 years of use Coffee machine is nice and compact and holds a good amount of water. However it vibrates a lot and i would have to watch and hold the cup as it pours espresso in case it vibrated off the cupstand. The coffee was ok, a good crema but it felt a bit watery. The pods are not stocked in most supermarkets, I could only find in sainsbury's or via amazon. Limited variety. The machine is incredibly noisy and started leaking just over a year of use, after 18 months it blew itself up. Literally it went 'bang', tripped my fuseboard and shorted itself. It turns on but it wont function. I wont purchase a lavazza machine again. That being said my other half has the Jolie machine and this works very well, is not as noisey, doesn't leak and is still functioning correctly and he's had it longer than i had this machine. Maybe it's just this style.	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2022-04-10	Machine Performance, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Brand Awareness, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Simplest system of all capsule machines I had another type of machine in a holiday home and the guests couldn't use it, they always ruined so many capsules. I saw this one at a relative's and I have to say that this system is much simpler. You open a drawer, insert the capsule, close it and by pressing the button a good coffee comes out.

for the moment nothing to say in a week you can't evaluate who knows what, but it's simple like the dolce gusto with the capsules that are not inserted with pressure but only work with a button. removable capsule holder that can be cleaned and changed. the only aspect that doesn't satisfy me is the water container that is inserted into a side slot with pressure. however it is small and takes up little space. like ALL coffee machines, it leaks water underneath and I recommend putting a container underneath to empty. in a few years I will be able to tell you more, but I guarantee that I was not satisfied with the 2010 turquoise machine that at the time was only sold online by lavazza that arrived with a broken capsule holder that needed replacing, then it tripped the electricity for a reason I never understood and barely dispensed. 12 years ago the coffee was as good as it is now, the lavazza aroma is unmistakable. and the original dolce gusto are much better than the nespresso and dolce gusto compatible ones. if you like lavazza, I recommend EXCLUSIVELY a modo mio rather than any compatible one, with machines that now no longer have the defects of once	amazon.it	3.0	2022-11-28	User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Brand Awareness, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability	tiny

6 months old Product initially good, after 6 months it no longer works. I asked the seller for help and he dismissed me saying that he could do something within 1 month. Too bad that by law there should be at least a 1 year warranty. I requested an invoice to be able to have it looked at by a local technician and nothing disappeared.

Noisy, vibrates, but makes an excellent cup of coffee. Bought this 'new' only to find it was full of coffee grouts. However it's an easy machine to use and produces a good cup of coffee. It does vibrate a lot and requires the cup to be held in position to stop it vibrating off the plinth (as I found out). It's also very noisy but I'm not bothered about the noise. Despite it's shortcomings, it does the job and that's what counts.	ebay.com	3.0	2019-05-15	Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

"Lavazza Tiny Black coffee machine Extremely easy to use, is ready in a very short time after switching on and I like the tiny size which is perfect for my very tiny kitchen and stylish in looks which is important for something which I want to leave out rather than keeping in a cupboard. I note from Lavazza's own website that it won a design award in 2018. The tray where you place your cup can be removed in order to fit a larger one in position if you want a ""lungo"" rather than an ""espresso"". The only thing which some people (although not myself) might find a problem is that the capsules are not so easily available in shops as the more popular types such as Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, but all large supermarkets will have them and they are easy to get online."	ebay.com	5.0	2019-09-12	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics, User Experience	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Great machine, some advice I am a big fan of this machine, it is small, compact and elegant, I bought two because I did not give the first one due care, some advice to avoid making my mistakes. -use filtered water in the machine, not necessarily bottled water, just use filtered water from jugs like Brita. -do a descaling treatment every month if you use tap water, it is a machine that suffers a lot from limescale, with filtered water much less frequently. -use original capsules or compatible with valid capsules, not harder than the originals, the teeth on the piston can get ruined. If the review was useful to you, leave me a thumbs up, I am very happy!	amazon.it	5.0	2023-03-07	Design and Materials		tiny

INFO!!! I have had the Lavazza Tiny Bianca for a good year. I would like to point out that since it is obsessed with maintenance, the machine is cleaned regularly with the appropriate product, and after each coffee I do a round of cleaning with only water. Lately, I noticed thanks to the LEDs placed above the kitchen counter, that in the corners of the water dispenser you could slightly see a green spot (I repeat almost imperceptible if you look at it with the light). I thought it was strange, because the water strictly from the bottle inside is put just right to avoid it remaining there too long etc... oh well... in the end I found the problem. The spring placed inside the piston located in the water dispenser gets dirty with this green. As if it oxidized every time. Does it happen to you too or am I the only one who found the defective machine? THANKS FOR THE ATTENTION :face_holding_back_tears:	amazon.it	2.0	2023-07-17		Maintenance and Durability	tiny

For the moment disappointed by the lavazza group. The machine looks very good, nice and small and usually very efficient. I had an identical one but after 3 years I fused it and it's ok but until the end it always made a good coffee... with this one I was included the pods of the lavazza red blend are really pitiful worse than an American coffee, burnt taste no creaminess in fact it seems dirty water, now I have ordered my pods of the borbone the usual pod that I used before let's see if it will make a good coffee, since I also tried the lavazza blend gold kit but it doesn't satisfy me in terms of flavor, if even in that case the coffee is not good I will be forced to return it due to malfunction of the machine	amazon.it	1.0	2022-11-17	Design and Materials	Coffee Quality	tiny

Excellent value for money! I had a very expensive Gaggia, which consumed and lost a lot of water, and required constant cleaning and maintenance. So much so that I had to throw it away after not even 2 months of use. I bought this Lavazza machine after reading the reviews and attracted by the price. I would say it is ideal, it does not require any type of maintenance, only emptying the drawer underneath every time it fills with water.

Good!! Arrived perfectly packaged, inside there were 64 capsules plus nine of these in the photo... to get an idea of ​​all the flavors. The Coffee in the photo is the decaffeinated one, very good. The machine is just the right amount of noise, not excessively. The cup stays still and doesn't move like I saw in other videos. Simple to use, just one click and it heats up quickly. The only flaw, it doesn't come out very hot like at the bar or moka, which I would like more... you have to click again to stop it. I find it functional, compact and easy. I recommend it, especially for the fact that it also has 73 capsules!!	amazon.it	4.0	2022-09-21	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, User Experience, Services and Logistics	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

Excellent machine, coffee a little less The machine does its job very well, this is the second one I buy. Above all because its coffee is hot and always creamy for me the number one.

"Acceptable coffee as long as the machine works The coffee is acceptable, nothing special. Tried all the versions and the ""best"" of all was the INTENSO. Tried other brands too and they turned out to be really bad. This was until it lasted: 6 months. In fact, after 6 months of brewing with great difficulty of coffee, it finally decided to stop brewing. I strongly advise against buying it.

Perfect with the right pods I took two, one for us and one for my in-laws. Beautiful, ergonomic, easy to use and clean. The coffee comes out well but I don't like it very much with Lavazza pods, I tried the red one and the trial kit with 9 different pods... I find them very watery and commercial... being of Calabrian origins I ordered Caffè Guglielmo pods..... both the classic ones and the 100% Arabica ones... what can I say, PERFECT COFFEE!!!! a cream that not even at the bar!

Really TINY It is my first capsule machine (I used a pod machine) and I must say that I have to take back what I have always said and thought, because without any doubt the quality of the coffee is much higher. This machine is tiny (from the photo you can see it next to a cup), compact, quite silent, but above all very easy to use and clean; the capsule is placed in a completely removable horizontal drawer which avoids annoying jamming and facilitates cleaning (friendly witnesses who have one where the apsule are inserted vertically). Behind the cup-holder grill there is a transparent drawer (I think it is the result of an extra space as it is not even indicated in the instruction booklet) inside which I found a few drops of liquid that might be transhipped from the same drip tray. The product includes a pack of 9 Lavazza pods of various flavors; I tried both original and compatible capsules and in all cases the coffee was full-bodied and creamy. exceeded my expectations, highly recommended purchase!	amazon.it	5.0	2020-06-14	Machine Performance, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience		tiny

"It met all expectations I bought this Lavazza in my own way to replace a Nespresso U that had broken. I must say that I used the excellent Borbone red quality Respresso compatibles and I was hesitating whether to switch to the Lavazza system, but I must say that it is even better considering that the ""system"" is identical to the espresso one, but the capsules have more coffee in fact they are 7.5g and therefore the coffee is more full-bodied and aromatic while paying the same price as the previous ones, so I consider myself fully satisfied."	amazon.it	5.0	2018-12-21	Price & worth, Coffee Quality		tiny
Not satisfied and the machine does not work after a few months. The machine vibrates and is noisy, also mine stopped dispensing coffee after a few months and when I called Lavazza assistance they told me that using compatible capsules will ruin the teeth of the dispenser ... The call for Lavazza assistance is paid with a complex procedure that I did not expect with also a video call and you need to have at least one original Lavazza capsule to start the collection and repair. Anyway one star is already too much.	amazon.it	1.0	2021-12-02		Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny

Compact and easy to use * SHIPPING AND PACKAGING * The item arrives in a few days in its original cardboard box containing, in addition to the machine complete with all accessories, the instruction booklet and 4 packs of 16 red Lavazza capsules. * WHAT IS IT LIKE? * The machine is very compact, not bulky at all, so it is suitable for use in any space, even the smallest. It has a drawer where the capsules are inserted and no tank for collecting used capsules, so it must be emptied manually after each coffee. For me this is not a problem, as I find that accumulating used capsules for days and days is not very hygienic. At the top there is a single button that serves both to turn it on and off, and to start and stop the coffee dispensing. If you do not turn it off manually, the machine also has an automatic switch-off after about 10 minutes of inactivity. The power cable is unfortunately very short and this can be a problem if you do not have a socket nearby. The tank holds about 700 ml of water and has a convenient top cap that allows you to fill it without removing it. * FUNCTIONALITY * From the moment you turn it on, the machine is ready to dispense coffee in a few seconds, so it's absolutely convenient in the morning if you're in a hurry. The Lavazza capsules obviously work well, but I also found the Borbone ones to be perfectly suitable, which have never given me any problems. * QUALITY - PRICE * The current price is about 80 euros, for the quality of the item I think it's a very good price. * RECOMMENDED? * For the ease of use and good quality, definitely yes. I hope my opinion is useful to you, if so let me know!	amazon.it	5.0	2021-12-12	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Services and Logistics, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

All ok Great machine, I chose the smallest one for space reasons, aware of the fact that it needs to be cleaned after each use, both because it has no drawer for used pods, and because the one that collects the dripping water is really small.

always the number 1 I have already bought 4... the latest version is a bomb!!! just be careful because when you make coffee your house can vibrate!!!

Indispensable! Satisfied with the purchase. It is a very simple machine, I find it better than the first A modo mio Lavazza. Practical to use and quick to turn on, the capsules do not jam, they are removed manually every time you make a new coffee. It seems like a good product and does not take up much space, in fact the minimum necessary. It makes a bit of noise, like other machines. It is useful for having a good coffee at home as in the bar, in fact perhaps even better!	amazon.it	4.0	2019-10-18	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Design and Materials, Machine Performance	tiny

It vibrates more than an 80's washing machine It's cute, compact and overall works reasonably well. The problem is that it vibrates so much that it knocks over disposable cups during brewing. The coffee comes out a little too cold even after making more than one.	amazon.it	2.0	2022-02-21	Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny
Very good machine. The real problem is the capsules supplied, mixed Arabica espresso, really strong flavor for those like me who have switched from the moka to the machine. I would argue for a box of capsules for each type. Also because the tasting kit of 9 capsules they give you is 1 for each type, so you have to pass the cup around to the various family members to taste the different types and then decide which ones to buy. For everything else, the machine is excellent. Advice to avoid long-term damage from limescale: buy a case of natural water and use it to refill the tank.	amazon.it	3.0	2019-10-09	User Experience	Coffee Quality	tiny

"Overall a good purchase Overall a good purchase, especially for the excellent offer with the capsules included, the red ones to which are added 9 more of various types that I found in the machine's packaging. although I expected a little more. As you can see from the video, the machine is quite noisy and ""vibrating"". If the paper cup is used, it moves completely during the coffee dispensing due to excessive vibrations. The coffee comes out hot and creamy, but the first one I made had a ""burnt"" aftertaste. I am also not completely satisfied with the capsule system: first of all, the compartment in which the capsule is inserted must be completely extracted, it does not stop; furthermore, before buying this, I used a Nespresso Inissia, which was equipped with a drawer in which after making the coffee, the used capsule automatically descended, thus leaving the capsule compartment free for the next coffee, and did not make a mess. This one instead does not have this system, after each coffee the capsule must be removed and residues of water and coffee are found on it, which causes it to drip when it is removed and replaced with the new one. Furthermore, always in comparison with the nespresso inissia, in which you could also set the desired length for the delivery, as well as choosing whether long or short thanks to the double button, this one instead does not have this function, so when you have reached the desired length you have to press the button again.

Compact, beautiful and powerful If you like good Italian coffee, thick, creamy and strong, you have no choice but to buy this Lavazza Tiny coffee machine. Small, not bulky but excellent for value for money. It arrives perfectly packaged in a large box with the coffee machine inside, the manual is in several languages, including Italian, and a nice box with 12 original Lavazza pods to try. So far it hasn't given me the slightest problem and I'm extremely satisfied. The water heats up immediately after switching it on and the coffee comes out creamy and strong, just the way I like it. Highly recommended to everyone, if you want high quality coffee and a machine that isn't bulky but very useful, buy it with your eyes closed.	amazon.it	5.0	2021-01-09	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics		tiny

A good day starts in the morning!! I literally wouldn't know what to do without it. Excellent, creamy and hot coffee for a good morning worthy of being called such!!! Easy to use and clean! I chose it from many on the market precisely because of its small size... for those who, like me, have very little space on the kitchen counter, but don't want to give up the pleasure of a good coffee in the morning, highly recommended. Many colors available, but I took it in black to give a break in my white and modern kitchen.	amazon.it	5.0	2020-10-28	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience		tiny
Excellent for price quality I bought several Lavazza coffee machines. They are great for convenience and accounting. I have used the old model for years; the new one I can say that in comparison it is smaller and does not have the possibility to contain the used capsules. But the thing I absolutely dislike is that it vibrates a lot and is very loud. This leads me to prefer the old model	amazon.it	3.0	2021-02-22	User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Must have and give as a gift! I bought this machine as a gift (which was very much appreciated) to my mother. It is small and compact and makes excellent coffee from the first use (though I recommend following the instructions and dispensing only water at the beginning for better cleaning). It is very easy to clean, but a bit noisy (its only “defect”, if you can call it that). The price is negligible, considering that it comes with 64 pods and an additional pack of 9, selected by Lavazza. In short, it is an excellent product, with a modern design and for all budgets.

Lavazza always the best When we first bought it we thought about returning it because it is very noisy when it dispenses coffee, but all in all it is a noise that then decreases and you get used to it also because it is for a very short time. Lavazza coffee has a unique flavor, we use the Crema and Forte flavor capsules and anyone who has tasted it has told us that it is really good. Easy to use as you just have to remove the drawer to insert the capsule and then press the dispensing button that allows you to decide the length of the coffee at the time, to clean it just remove the various drawers with a sponge and descale every now and then.	amazon.it	4.0	2021-01-14	Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality, User Experience	Machine Performance, User Experience	tiny

Noisy and uncomfortable Easy to use, compatible with many pods of brands other than Lavazza. Cons: it vibrates a lot and is very noisy. You have to hold the cup still with your hand to prevent the vibrations from moving it (and making it fall). I have also changed several surfaces/furniture on which the machine is located, but nothing changes. In the morning to make coffee you have to close two doors, otherwise it would wake up those who are still sleeping.	amazon.it	3.0	2020-06-23	User Experience, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

fake repairs The machine stopped working after a few months of use, the engine was working but the pump was not drawing water. Amazon only gave me the option of sending it in for repair, for this product there is no refund or replacement, ONLY REPAIR. I then bought a new machine, at my own expense, so as not to be left without coffee and this one was with the technicians for a month and then returned... more broken than before. The box that was intact was torn, the power button looked like it had been punched and was stuck inside. No possibility of functioning. When plugging it in the only flashing light was red and there was no possibility of intervening, as the button was blocked. In the end Amazon solved the problem adequately but the technicians who deal with repairs would be better off changing jobs. Hope it doesn't stop working because it's an odyssey...	amazon.it	1.0	2019-08-18	Services and Logistics	Maintenance and Durability, Services and Logistics, User Experience	tiny

"Small and unstoppable After years of honorable service, my old ""minu"" had some sporadic power-on problems. I immediately hurried to buy a new small Lavazza machine. The machine comes in a box that includes, in addition to the manuals, a set of tasting pods. The glossy black color is very elegant. The coffee is switched on and dispensed with a single button on the top. When switched on, the flashing indicates the heating phase, the steady light indicates that the machine is ready and warm. I chose the Tiny instead of the Jolie because I prefer not to have the waffle drawer worn out. I prefer to have everything in order and clean, in order to avoid that some careless person in the house (including me), puts another capsule in a full drawer and everything jams. Ultimately, I would buy back with my eyes closed because: - is small - delivers hot and creamy coffee (the use of compatible capsules that I prefer is also fine) - easy to clean. The only drawback, negligible: - moves a little during the brewing phase and is also a bit noisy"	amazon.it	5.0	2020-04-03	User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	Machine Performance	tiny

The machine has a nice design but has a very serious problem: during delivery it vibrates so strongly that it moves and moves and sometimes falls the cup, so much so that you are forced to hold it with your hands to keep it still, a defect that no coffee machine should have; I recommend you get the Jolie model because this Tiny from what I understand has many problems!	amazon.it	2.0	2019-11-15	Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Wonderful Wonderful design. Simple to use. One button. Easy to clean. Doesn't make much noise as they say. Hot coffee but not boiling.

Those who spend little have little The machine takes up little space and the lack of a compartment for used capsules encourages more differentiation. But if we talk about the quality of the coffee dispensed, the score is low. Not being able to pre-set the length of the coffee is already a big handicap. If you get distracted for a moment, everything overflows. Then also the flavor is very plastic. Anyway, it's a question of personal taste.

Lavazza a modo mio. As always Amazon respects the expected times, excellent product I highly recommend for those who want to switch to the coffee machine, I tried the capsules included with the machine brand lavazza rossa intensity 10 and I have to say excellent I love the taste of strong and decisive coffee and really excellent, I will try I will also try the free samples that they gave me before dwelling on the thought of the taste lavazza rossa intensity 10 maybe I will change my mind also with different flavors that lavazza offers but for the moment I remain of the idea that for those who love a strong and intense coffee the intensity 10 and that they give you with the machine is really excellent. Just as the lavazza a modo mio coffee machine is excellent, it is true that in dispensing the coffee it is not as super fast as one imagines but not slow either, but in the end what counts is the intensity of the coffee let's be clear when a machine dispenses the coffee in light time in the end it is because it is dirty water which does not happen with lavazza.

Creaminess and flavor of real bar coffee 2) After 2 days of use, even if not intense, as I imagined: Lavazza A modo mio coffee machine, as if it were a moka pot, has gained a lot of flavor and now the coffee is really good... For a creamy and intense coffee like a true Neapolitan coffee, I recommend taking INTENSE coffee capsules (rich, robust, creamy flavor) 1) For now I'm waiting on the flavor evaluation because I'm at the first cups of coffee, and the machine hasn't yet taken on that creamy coffee flavor	amazon.it	5.0	2021-01-08	Coffee Quality		tiny

this machine is beautiful, suitable for use in the office and at home I was surprised how small it is, I've never seen a machine like this, and the coffee is also very tasty, only it has a small flaw it vibrates a little too much and therefore you have to keep the glass underneath to prevent it from falling, only for this you do not it deserves the fifth star, otherwise it would have been really perfect !!!	amazon.it	4.0	2021-04-15	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	Maintenance and Durability	tiny
Good coffee The machine is small but well made with fairly sturdy material. Nice design. Creamy coffee, although I don't know the long-term yield. It is quick to turn on and has only one start and stop button. It does not have a used pod compartment, but it is easy to remove and the machine always remains clean. It is not very noisy but, especially at the beginning, it vibrates a lot and you have to be careful with the cup.

"The best for the ""My Way"" standard by Lavazza I had a Lavazza ""Jolie"" for a long time. The pump started acting up, after years, it couldn't take it anymore, I decided to change. I saw that there are two or three other models. One of them has a sensor that tells you when you need to empty the used capsule collector, another has a timed operation and stops when the coffee has come out. All highly useless things, in my opinion. The one that stops by itself takes too long, the one that tells you when you need to empty the capsules tells you when there are three (six should fit) only because they fit together badly and there is little space. The ""normal"" Jolie was still the best, but I saw this ""Tiny"" that seemed to be the simplest and cheapest. In fact it does NOT have a collector for used capsules, but a little drawer that every time you make a coffee you take it out, remove the old one, put the new one in. This machine is simple, functional, costs less than all the others, it stays clean because... it doesn't get dirty, it doesn't make that smelly sludge of used capsules... Technical note: in the Jolie, once the capsule is inserted, a lever that you operate by hand blocks it and activates the mechanism that pierces it. The Tiny, on the other hand, has no lever. Basically, the first phase of pressure dispensing serves to activate the plunger that pierces the capsule, after which the dispensing begins. This means that the initial phase is a little noisier (as you can read in other reviews where the reason was not explained). A positive consequence is that it is also easy to extract compostable capsules, which in the normal Jolie tend to deform due to the heat and sometimes get stuck inside. The capsule holder drawer can be removed easily and rinsed in two seconds, while on the other machines this cannot be done for obvious reasons. The Tiny's operating mode is the best I've seen. Special mention for the drip collector. When it's full it starts to spill on a little drawer behind (which can also be emptied). This allows you to take it out when you still have time to avoid the risk of dripping on the floor. As for the standard ""A modo mio"" by Lavazza, a bargain. It comes with 64 ""Red Quality"" capsules, which is actually very good, and a sample of nine different types of capsules, in case you want to decide which ones to order next time. Obviously you can use any compatible capsule. Below are the pros and cons in my opinion. I haven't found any cons, but I had to include at least one... PROS - it costs less than the others - more efficient capsule piercing mechanism - throwing away the capsule and replacing it guarantees cleanliness - it comes with 73 coffee capsules (64 + 9, see above) CONS - the first phase of dispensing is noisier"	amazon.it	5.0	2022-02-16	Price & worth, Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility	Price & worth, Machine Performance, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Easy to use machine, terrible coffee. The machine is normal, it's the second one I buy, after all they are all made of plastic and have a limited lifespan... The coffee supplied, Lavazza Rossa, it's an insult to call it coffee, dirty water is undrinkable.	amazon.it	4.0	2022-05-19	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials	Coffee Quality	tiny
Excellent The machine with the Lavazza pods supplied can produce excellent coffee and does so in a short time, in fact it can heat water in a very short time starting from the machine completely turned off. Under the dispenser we find space for a normal coffee cup or containers that are not too bulky, but if you want to insert a taller glass to make a latte macchiato I simply remove the base (which is interlocking and just slides it out) and you can do it. For normal maintenance all the parts are removable and easy to clean, if we really want to find a fault at all costs we can at most say that the machine is small and slightly noisy, nothing more. In short I recommend it to those who have to make 3 or 4 coffees a day and do not want a device that is too bulky. For me it is 5 stars, absolutely satisfied!	amazon.it	5.0	2021-07-12	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience		tiny

Tiny espresso power! I've owned this espresso maker for a few months now and it is superb at doing that one job: making espresso coffee. It isn't an all singing, all dancing coffee machine: it makes espresso. You can have a short espresso or a long espresso by turning it off / on for shorter / longer. It only fits espresso cups. That's it. If you want to make any other type of coffee, then buy a different machine. But for me it's perfect as I just want espresso coffee. I see other reviewers reporting problems but I've had none - its quick, easy to use and clean, and it is no noisier than any other coffee machine. My local supermarkets stock the pods and it came with some too so worked out as good value. The coffee is full and rich - easily as good as that available in any uk high street coffee shop; not as good as you'd get in a cafe in Italy. I run a bit of water through without a capsule before each use to clean and pre-heat, and that improves the flavour and heat.	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2022-04-21	Price & worth, Machine Performance, User Experience, Coffee Quality, Capsules and Compatibility	Design and Materials, User Experience	tiny

"Practical, light, small, quick to use and clean. Excellent offer. Also appreciated is the package with the free trial pods of different ""flavors"". Very quick to use and heats up in less than 30 seconds (even when just turned on). The only choice I don't understand: why just one button? ""Hold down for 5 seconds to turn on and off"" ""Press to dispense and to stop dispensing"" Why not an extra button to turn on and off? Why hold down the same button for 5 seconds that if you accidentally let go 1 second before, it starts pouring more boiling water where there is no longer a cup? ""Light on"", ""Flashing light"", ""Fast flashing light"", ""Red light""... all on the same button.

Simple, functional, and small but solid and refined. Given that every two or three years we find ourselves having to change the espresso machine (despite using only low-residue bottled water and regular descaling), this time we decided to spend a more reasonable amount than we had done until now. For the moment the machine behaves very well. It has only one button that is used to turn it on, dispense, stop and turn it off. This detail had initially made me doubt its quality, but I changed my mind very quickly. Practical and not ordinary. The line is pleasant and the body is not invasive (I bought it in black). The small size is perfect for reducing the clutter on the kitchen worktop. I thought I had taken a step back and that the low cost would have made me regret not having opted for a rental in exchange for the supply of coffee, but that was not the case. The quantity of pods supplied with the purchase alone makes the cost of the machine comparable to that of a moka, but for me who doesn't like that type of coffee it was a lifesaver. Cleaning is very simple, thanks also to the fact that it doesn't have a capsule collection compartment (I always thought it was an essential option, but I was wrong) just a quick rinse of a tray under the tap and the machine is perfect again. Overall very satisfied. Exceeded expectations. I would like to point out, after two years, that regular descaling guarantees a long life for the machine.	amazon.it	4.0	2018-11-16	Price & worth, User Experience, Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Maintenance and Durability	Price & worth, Maintenance and Durability	tiny

...an excellent coffee... I bought this coffee machine 7/8 months ago, and I have to say that it makes an excellent coffee (although obviously it depends on the quality of the coffee). The problem is that it broke a couple of months ago (it leaks water) and through Amazon I had no problems sending it to assistance, but unfortunately due to the great inconvenience of this period I have not yet had an answer. So I await news and for the moment I give 4 stars for Amazon's organization and for the quality of the coffee...

Excellent value for money. Simple to use and clean. Takes up very little space Small and discreet, it takes up very little space in the kitchen. In an instant it is hot and ready to make an excellent coffee. The fact that it does not have a collection drawer for used capsules I find an advantage and certainly not a defect: once the coffee is made, the capsule holder support is removed, the used capsule is thrown away and the machine is ready for the next coffee. All at a reasonable price and also with the red quality capsules for free. In short, not to be missed.	amazon.it	5.0	2021-09-20	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility		tiny

Small and compact Small Compact and economical. A machine for those who have no high demands on convenience. It makes coffee very well, although it all depends on which capsules you buy of course. It does its job very well. Obviously it lacks some conveniences, such as the capsule collection tray which is completely manual, between one coffee and the next the magazine must be taken out, emptied and reloaded with the new capsule, it makes no difference to me.

Burnt coffee Unfortunately, given the negative experience, I am forced to reformulate my opinion on the machine. After 4 months of use with hundreds of capsules, all the Lavazzas available on the market and a varied series of compatibles, the machine is unable to make a coffee that is at least acceptable. The flavor, without sugar obviously, tastes like burnt coffee. I asked Amazon for a replacement. I will issue a judgment after testing the replacement. The advice, based on my experience, is to postpone your purchase.	amazon.it	1.0	2022-02-02	Design and Materials	Coffee Quality, Services and Logistics	tiny
Lavazza my way! The machine itself is a little too light, for the rest, it made a good coffee, with foam, and with a good scent and a valid aroma.

Nice machine shame about the functionality The coffee produced is of very good quality, I think this also depends a lot on the type of coffee you use. However, I don't judge the quality of the coffee because I don't consider myself an expert.

Bring back the A Mido Mio Mini I bought this to replace my leaking A Modo Mio Mini. Unfortunately this machine is a grossly inferior product. Firstly the glass lungo cups that I usually use are too tall for the machine. The coffee is not as hot as with the Amodo Mio Mini and tastes different. It is extremely noisy and causes the worktop to vibrate. Aesthetically it is acceptable but it fails in all other respects.	amazon.co.uk	1.0	2021-11-13		Design and Materials, Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance, Coffee Quality	tiny

Negative reviews are misguided... I'm surprised by the recent negative reviews, but from reading them I realised they are not using this properly or making coffee the right way. This is an ESSPRESSO maker. It does that very well and efficiently. People complained that only a tiny cup fits under the spout...well that's by design, this machine is designed to be the smallest model Lavazza have. Also an espresso cup or shot glass will fit perfectly. To make drinks like cappuccino and latte, you add hot milk to a cup and pour in the espresso shot in last, so again a shot glass is perfect for this. People complained about longer drinks not tasting so good...this is an espresso machine, espresso is 50ml max. Add that to hot water for an americano if you want a bigger coffee, or really the proper thing is to brew coffee with a cafetiere, filter coffee machine or pour over a filter. Ok, so now that's covered, I'll review the machine itself. I had an older Lavazza a Modo Mio machine that broke after 6 years. That one, like the Lavazza Jolie, had a lever on the top to lock the pod into place and collected the pods inside the machine, this compartment gets a bit wet too so 3 or 4 parts would need to go in the dishwasher. The Tiny machine just has a drawer at the front that you pull out and place the pod on, that's far easier to load and empty. There is less mess under and much less cleaning after. The button is easier to operate than the lever. The machine is noisy but I wouldn't say it's going to wake the neighbours. Also it only makes noise for the 20 seconds it's pouring the espresso. The noise is the only real downside, but I dont know if quiet machines are a thing. This is a really nice neat extremely small simple espresso maker. I have a milk frother already so this was all I needed. Personally I love lavazza coffee, there are a lot of different strengths of pods to try. This machine is free pour, meaning I push the button to start and stop the espresso making. I like this as it lets me choose how much I want. You can read up about the differences between espresso and ristretto, which are different volumes and give a different flavour. Other more expensive machines pour specific amounts, so if that's an issue you can look for a machine that suits you. Also people saying they dont like the taste are probably pouring far too much, because once you have over 50mls only bitter flavour espresso will come out because the best flavour has already been extracted. I like this machine because it is simple and just gives me espresso quickly. The quality of espresso isn't going to be better in the £200 machines, they have other bells and whistles which might be useful but I don't think this machine actually lacks anything.	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2021-11-19	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	Design and Materials, Machine Performance	tiny
Small in size but makes great coffee. Worst part about it is finding pods for it and not being able to use reusable pods with it. However, much better coffee than other similar machines.	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2022-05-25	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials	Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

Updated review After a week’s use I am now better pleased with this machine. Other buyers may be interested to learn that the quite loud noise which many mention, and the considerable vibration it emits, have both been rectified in my case by repositioning the machine onto a really level surface. I moved mine for quite another reason (general convenience of use) and was astonished to notice the difference. The earlier position, when checked, revealed a slight irregularity in the surface which was causing the problem. I am now happy with the machine, and have awarded it another star.	amazon.co.uk	4.0	2023-07-01	User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny

Easy to use for great coffee! I absolutely love this machine. It’s compact so doesn’t take up much room in my small kitchen. I’m just not good at remembering complicated steps for use and need appliances that have few steps to use and this machine fits the bill. It’s simple and easy for me to remember what to do. I get a delicious cup (or mug) of Lavazza coffee which is, in my humble opinion one of the best tasting coffee around today! The temperature of the coffee is just right for me but can be hotter if you rinse out your cup/mug with boiling hot water (just be careful as the rim of the cup will be very hot!) Although I have a Nespresso milk frother and can add milk using that, I find that if I add a small quantity of milk to the bottom of my cup, the bar pressure somehow presses the coffee out and the milk rises to the top of the cup in a somewhat ‘frothy’ sort of way!! Not a perfect cappuccino but still good to me albeit a lazy version!! A sprinkle of cocoa on the top and voila! Made in no time! You can use non Lavazza coffee pods in this machine which tend to be cheaper and can make a decent cup of coffee if you wish. Whatever is your favourite way of drinking coffee be it espresso, latte or cappuccino can be achieved using this ‘tiny’ machine. If you want latte then add hot steamed milk to your espresso!!	amazon.co.uk	5.0	2023-06-02	Design and Materials, Coffee Quality, Machine Performance, User Experience	Coffee Quality	tiny

fantastic coffee making I love this coffee machine and the coffee. Makes perfect coffee, every time. Easy to use. Compact.

Unsealed package and clearly already used product The package was not sealed and the coffee machine has already been used since some components were dirty with coffee. Product taken with a strong discount and with the arrival of the same on a date to be determined...

"Waschmaschine oder Kaffeemaschine The device has a nice small format. Horizontal capsule feed seems logical and sensible. I filled the water tank twice and let it run through completely. What was noticeable was the extremely loud, uneven noise and very strong vibrations while the pump is running. The water in the tank vibrates so much that it forms very clear patterns and the kitchen table vibrates considerably. It is unclear to me how something like this can be built or whether it is a faulty appliance. I sent it back the next day. To my ""delight"", postage from Berlin to Manchester cost €29.99.

Purchased to replace the old Lavazza a Modo Mio model I had to replace Lavazza a Modo Mio because, after years of intense work, it no longer worked. I chose to rely on the leading brand again and opt for the same model and I must say that my trust was rewarded. The compact size fits well even in my mini kitchen, and it makes excellent coffee. The only flaw is the collector in the lower part, smaller than that of the previous model. It needs to be emptied every 3/4 coffees, but for the rest I would say that it is truly an excellent choice, with a good quality/price ratio.	amazon.it	5.0	2024-02-15	Price & worth, Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, Brand Awareness	Maintenance and Durability, Design and Materials, Capsules and Compatibility	tiny

As cheap as it is low quality This is the second identical machine that I buy: I have to say that, despite the affordable price, the life of the machine is really short. Less than a year later it is already having a lot of problems (overheating, problems with piercing the capsules, water leaks) despite having regularly done the anti-scale cycles for maintenance. I strongly recommend moving to a higher range and brand, the prices will be higher but it will certainly last much longer.	amazon.it	2.0	2024-04-19		Design and Materials, Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tiny
Keeping things simple, what a pleasure! Let's be clear: this machine dispenses shots of espresso. That's all. It does it really well. What more can I say? The reason I've knocked a star off the perfect rating is that the first one I had lasted just over a year before refusing to see the water hopper. The second machine is into its second or third year now with no problems, though.

Un produit de très bonne qualité avec un joli design. It's fantastic! I used to have red. The only reason I changed it was because it didn't match the color of the kitchen cabinets! I think the old one is over 3 years old and still works like new. I hope this one will be just like it. It's very easy to clean.

This version seems to have solved some defects found in the old model (eg: Less vibration and noise) and I can consider myself satisfied with the purchase. The only ""negative note"" (if I may say so) could be the cost that when it is not on sale is really out of what for me is considered a normal ""Quality/Price"" ratio which in this case is strongly unbalanced towards the top.

Lavazza Tiny Unfortunately I don't like the coffee, it comes out cold and too long even though I stop the button first. The tank is tiny. I expected better.	mediaworld.it	1.0	2023-08-27	Maintenance and Durability	Coffee Quality, Machine Performance	tinyeco

Good coffee Maybe it's early to review, but at the moment I can say that it's a good purchase...

Excellent machine, very good coffee. Small, comfortable and very good coffee...

Nothing short of wonderful. I highly recommend this coffee machine, it makes exceptional coffee! It always depends on the brand of coffee you use but it's like at the bar.

product complaint the machine leaks water at the base. under the warranty I took it to mediaword for repair, but time passes and I find myself without a machine. for this reason I bought another one with the hope that it does not have the defect found in the first one. I made several phone calls but no one was able to give me an answer for the return (after repair)	mediaworld.it	2.0	2024-01-19		Maintenance and Durability, User Experience	tinyeco

I strongly advise against it. The machine did not convince me from the start, shortly after it started to make disgusting coffee, I tried to wash it and change several brands of coffee including the original ones, nothing doing, I contacted the seller who advised me to contact Lavazza assistance directly, my mother same product same identical problem.	amazon.it	1.0	2024-03-16		Maintenance and Durability, Coffee Quality	tinyeco
It's not worth the price It's not worth the price, 80/90€ and it doesn't even have a capsule holder. Each pod has to be put in and taken out.	mediaworld.it	3.0	2024-04-16		Price & worth, Capsules and Compatibility	tinyeco

Excellent coffee, small tank, excessively small tray I have the previous model that I use in another house and, since the old tiny one is no longer in production, I decided to buy this one. The positive side is that it makes excellent coffee and takes very little time to heat up. Noisier than the previous one, it also has a couple of other slightly unpleasant defects: the water tank is very small and must be filled continuously and the water collection tray is really tiny and, even if emptied every 3 or 4 dispensings, it fills up and lets the water overflow onto the shelf on which the machine is placed. All in all I would buy it again but it was a step backwards compared to the previous model.	amazon.it	3.0	2024-08-20	Coffee Quality, Design and Materials, User Experience	Maintenance and Durability, Machine Performance	tinyeco

Comparison machines Lavazza / Nespresso. An excellent espresso coffee machine, in my opinion, makes a coffee cream very similar to that of the café: The previous Nespresso machine was not up to par with this one.	mediaworld.it	5.0	2024-09-27	Coffee Quality		tinyeco
