If you want to start a coffee over 80 ml, start watching Lord of the Rings, maybe your coffee will be ready before the King returns... More seriously, a modo mio is typically made for the taste of Italian coffee (between 35 and 50 ml volume); There are many machines for brewing larger cups on the market, mainly those with built-in grinders. I have one of each in my kitchen, for totally different coffees...	1	Coffee Quality, Machine Performance	Coffee Quality	Machine Performance	Neutral

Hello, I am Italian. You have dispensed an enormous amount of coffee. The taste of one of those small pods can be better enjoyed in a much smaller quantity, like a short espresso, which equals 1/3 of a small coffee cup. Approximately 50 milliliters or 50 grams.

The coffee machine is excellent, but the problem are 5 exhausted capsules that are hardly contained in the drawer and often the last tends to fit ... I solved the problem by removing the second drawer inside that acts as a drip and finally everything is fine inHow much the space increases .... the little water inside not from any discomfort in disposal .... last advice always original capsules that never give problems and the quality remains superior ...__ Emoji0__	1	Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility, Maintenance and Durability	Machine Performance, Capsules and Compatibility	Maintenance and Durability	Positive
